As our world becomes increasingly interconnected, events occurring in one part of the world can have far-reaching consequences in another. Therefore, I strongly agree with the statement that it is important to know about events happening around the world, even if they are unlikely to affect our daily lives. In this essay, I will provide specific reasons and examples to support this viewpoint.

Firstly, being aware of global events can broaden our perspective and understanding of the world. Through exposure to diverse viewpoints and experiences, we can develop a more nuanced understanding of complex issues and challenges facing our world. For instance, following news about the ongoing conflict in Syria may not directly impact my life, but it can help me to better comprehend the complexities of international relations and the impact of war on civilians.

Secondly, knowledge of global events can also be beneficial in the long term. Events that may seem inconsequential at the moment can have far-reaching consequences over time. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic originated in China but has now affected nearly every country in the world, highlighting the importance of keeping up-to-date with global developments.

Moreover, knowledge of global events can also be important for personal safety and security. For example, if there is political unrest or natural disasters occurring in a country I plan to visit, being aware of the situation can help me to make informed decisions about whether or not to proceed with my travel plans.

In conclusion, it is important to know what is happening around the world. This is because watching global news can broaden your perspective on the world. And some events seem like will not affect you at the beginning, but maybe eventually they will affect you at the end. Finally, knowing what is happening at your travel destination can help you make your plan.
