In my opinion, I would definitely choose the large company, I feel this way for several reasons.
First, you know, if you don't have any experience of business and you still start your own business, then most likely you will fail. As a conclusion, I think I should take a job first, and then learn things from the job, and finally, I will decide whether or not starting my own business.
Second, in my country, starting a business is an extremely risky behavior. You know, not every country has a good business environment, especially those underdeveloped countries, and my country is an example of this. To be specific, if you want to start a business in my country, you have to have relationships with the government, otherwise, they will destroy your business in all kinds of ways. As a result, I don't think that investing in my country is a good idea.
