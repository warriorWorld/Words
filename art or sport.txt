In my country, most people think that governments should spend more money in support of sports, which will bring honor to our country. Personally, I believe that governments should spend more money in the support of the arts. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.
To begin with, a large number of studies have shown that arts, such as music can improve your mental health. My personal experience is a compelling example of this. Six years ago, when I just enter the workforce, I was so anxious about everything, am I good enough? can I make it before the deadline? Then one day I read an article online talking about music benefits concentration and make you relax. At first, I thought that this will not that simple. However, I later bought a headset, and then listen to music while I am working. I was surprised by the effect, I was so concentrated that I even forgot lunch, and I feel very comfortable even at work.
