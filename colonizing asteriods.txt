The reading and the lecture are both about the possibility of colonizing asteroids. While the author of the article argues that colonizing asteroids has scientific benefits economic benefits and long-term survival of human benefits, the lecture disputes the claims mentioned in the article.

According to the reading, colonizing asteroids provides scientific benefits, due to asteroids usually being small in size, having low gravity, and lacking an atmosphere. Which are good for research, moreover, asteroids could also serve as stepping stones for launching rockets. This argument is challenged by the lecture. He claims that we still lack enough knowledge about asteroids, and that makes the scientific benefits not guaranteed.

Secondly, the author suggests colonizing asteroids has economic value because asteroids usually have a lot of mineral resources and we can mine them and bring them to earth simultaneously this will reduce the mining of earth. The lecture, however, asserts that we don't know how many valuable materials those asteroids contain, and how much will cost the travel made, which makes the cost-efficiency not clear.

Finally, the author puts force the idea that colonizing asteroids benefits long-term human survival because it makes a separate home for humans as a species to avoid asteroid impact or a nuclear war effect. In contrast, the lectureâ€™s stance is most asteroids have low gravity relative to the earth, which will deal damage to human bones and muscles. These challenges could make living on those asteroids extremely unhealthy and dangerous in the long run.
