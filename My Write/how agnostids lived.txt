The reading and the lecture are both about how agnostids may have lived. While the author of the reading provides three arguments, however, the lecturer disputes all of the claims mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the article thinks that agnostids were free-swimming predators. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this claim by saying that all predators who dwell in water have large eyes to help them look for prey. But agnostids didn't have that, and many agnostids even were blind.
Secondly, the author of the reading says that agnostids likely are seafloor dwellers. However, the lecturer rebutted this argument by saying that seafloor dwellers usually move very slowly, thus, they often can only be found in small areas. But, agnostids fossils can be found at large distances, which indicates they were not likely seafloor dwellers.
Finally, the author of the reading argues that agnostids may be parasites. The lecturer casts doubt on this argument, She mentioned that parasites usually don't have large populations, this is because large populations of parasites will kill off the animal populations they live on.
