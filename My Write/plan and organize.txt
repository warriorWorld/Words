Most people in the world nowadays think that in today's complex society, young people should have planning and organizing abilities. Personally, I think young people don't need planning and organizing abilities in today's world. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.
To begin with, making a plan doesn't mean things will go smoothly with that plan, and doesn't mean people will follow that plan either. My personal experience is a compelling example of this. About five years ago, I decided to lose weight no matter what, and I planned every detail at that time, I planned everyday food intake and everyday exercise. In the beginning, the plan goes smoothly, but only several days later, I feel hungry and tired, and I can no longer maintain that plan soon I gave up that plan. After that, I planned several lose weight attempts, but all of it was failed. One year ago, I suddenly realized that a strict plan will not work for me, and I simply deduct my food intake every day and don't care how much of it was deducted. Today I already lose 10kg of my body weight.
Secondly, organizing something too strictly will lose a lot of fun on something. For example, about three years ago, my company organized a trip to Shanghai, and the organizer also my colleague organized strictly every detail of the travel. We went to Shanghai, and at every step, we followed his plan strictly. I must say that plan went smoothly, but it was not fun at all. About three months later, I went to Shanghai myself without any plan. I went to a lot of places accidentally, and I was very happy.
In conclusion, I strongly believe that young people don't need to plan and organize everything in their life. This is because people are most likely not will go with plans, and strictly organized plans are not fun at all.
