Most people in my country nowadays think that all university students should take history courses. On the other hand, Personally, I don't think all students should take history courses at all. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.
To begin with, a history course's perspective is always not objective in an authoritarian state, and usually, such State will describe their enemy negatively and describe themselves positively. And this kind of behavior is very detrimental, it leads to nationalism, nationalism leads to nazism, and eventually. nazism leads to war. My homeland's experience is a compelling example of this, my country's media show people historical events selectively, and they deliberately incite anti-Japanese sentiment. About ten years ago, a man uses a U-lock and attacked another man only because that man drive a car made in Japan. Without that kind of propaganda, I don't think this kind of event will happen.
On the other hand, the best way to learn something is to have an interest in something first. Personally, I think only those who study by themselves can truly be good at something. If you are interested in history, you should study by yourself not rely on school. My personal experience is a compelling example of this. About fifteen years ago, my Gaokao English only scored 30 out of 150, and when I finally went to the workforce, I realize how important English is, I started to learn English by myself and today I am here taking a TOEFL exam.
In conclusion, I strongly believe that universities shouldn't require all students to take history courses. This is because biased history courses lead to disasters, and if you want to study history, you should study by yourself, not by others' requirements.
