The reading and the lecture are both about whether or not the silver coin proved that the Norse traveled to America thousand years ago. While the author of the reading thinks that the coin is a historical fake, the lecturer disputes all of the claims mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the reading says that the coin was found far from the native American site, so it may be not related to it at all. However, the lecturer challenged this argument by saying that we've found a lot of things that are far from the site but related to the native people, and actually, the Natives do travel long distances a lot.
Secondly, the author of the article thinks that because there are no other coins found at that place, the Norse must didn't bring any silver coins with them at all. On the other hand, the lecturer rebutted this claim by saying that coins are valuable to the Norse, so they may just pack up all the other coins with them and then returned home.
Finally, the author of the reading claims that the natives have no use for coins, they don't see them as money, so they may have no interest in them. The lecturer disputes this argument by saying that it is true that the natives don't see coins as money, but they think it is pretty and they use it on jewelry and necklaces.
