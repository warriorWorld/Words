The reading and the lecture are both about whether pterosaurs were capable of powered flight. While the author of the reading claims that pterosaurs were not capable of powered flight, the lecturer disputes the claims mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the reading thinks that pterosaurs were cold-blooded, and since cold-blooded animals don't have enough energy to powered flight, the author thinks that pterosaurs also can not do powered flight. However, the lecturer casts doubt on this claim, she says that recently, scientists found that pterosaurs actually have fur-like or hair-like organs, and these kinds of organs usually can be found in warm-blooded animals, so maybe pterosaurs were warm-blooded animals and they can provide enough energy to do the powered flight.
Secondly, the author of the reading says that pterosaurs were too heavy to be able to do powered flight. On the other hand, the lecturer disputes this argument by mentioning that pterosaurs' bones were hollow, so they actually were very light.
Finally, the author of the article mentions that all animals with powered flight are either taking off from the ground by jumping or by running fast, but pterosaurs' back leg muscles were too weak to do that. The lecturer challenged this claim by mentioning that, despite the pterosaurs' back leg muscles being weak, but they use their four limbs to walk instead of just two limbs, so they can provide enough power to take off from the ground.
