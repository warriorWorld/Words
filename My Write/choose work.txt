It is critically important that people fulfill themselves with their work. In my opinion, workers are more satisfied when their works require a lot of different types of tasks. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.
To begin with, working with different types of tasks will improve your working capability. My personal experience is a compelling example of this. About eight years ago, when I finally had enough of as a building engineer, I determined to become a programmer, to be specific, an Android developer. Android development is a job that requires a lot of different types of tasks, at first, I didn't know this, and I am tired of having to learn a lot of new things every day as an Android developer. But gradually I started adapting to it and enjoying it, in addition, I learned a lot of things from it. Today, I already am an expert on Android. My example demonstrated how work that contains a lot of different kinds of tasks could improve one person's abilities.
Secondly, work that requires many different kinds of tasks can benefit your mental health and monotonous work will damage your mental health greatly. For instance, about five years ago, my friend also my schoolmate went into a factory and work as an assembly line worker. He once told me that he feels like he is a robot every day just assembling one ugly toy one after another with no thoughts and no emotions, and it is terrible. I feel sorry for him and advised him to learn something and change his job. His example demonstrates how a monotonous job can damage a person's mental health.
In conclusion, I strongly believe that we should choose a job that has a lot of kinds of tasks to do. This is because you can learn a lot of things and improve yourself from a job like this, and monotonous work is detrimental to one's mental health.
