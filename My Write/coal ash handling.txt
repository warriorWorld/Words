The reading and the lecture are both about whether or not we should stricter regulate for handling and storing of coal ash. While the author of the reading suggests we shouldn't stricter regulate it and provides three arguments, the lecturer however disputes all of the claims mentioned in the reading.
To begin with, the author of the article says that we already have regulations about handling coal ash such as regulating to use of liners. However, the lecturer disputes this claim by saying that those regulations are not enough, and they only regulate new build ponds to use liners, and the old ones are not restricted by those regulations. In addition, she mentions that there already have happened several leaking accidents. As a result, dangerous chemicals already leak into groundwater and contaminate drinking water.
Secondly, the author of the reading thinks that stricter regulations on coal ash will stop consumers to consume other ash coal products. The lecturer casts doubt on this argument, she says that this will not happen, and she provides one instance which is another restricted regulated material, and its consumers seem don't concern about this regulation and continue to buy its products.
Finally, the author puts forth that strict regulations on coal ash will increase electricity prices dramatically. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this claim by saying that if you calculate how much its cost will increase exactly by these kinds of regulations, it is about 150 million dollars. As a result, the electricity price will only increase by one percent.
