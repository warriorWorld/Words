It is critically important to make many new friends especially when you are in a competitive society nowadays. However, personally, I think it is more important to maintain friendships with a few people for happiness. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.
To begin with, long-term friends are more familiar with you, thus they most likely will recommend you some job that fits you best. My personal experience is a compelling example of this. About two years ago, my company laid off a lot of employees because of its financial crisis, and after that, I lost my job. half year later, my pre-colleague also my friend called me, and he recommend me a company. Later I went to that company, I was surprised that the company has absolutely no work overtime, which is very rare in my country. I know that is because my friend knows me very well, he knows that I never will work for a company that works overtime. And I work at that company very happy every day since then.
Secondly, old friends are more trustworthy, and their advice quality is guaranteed. For example, about five years ago, I had a strong urge to study English, because I want to migrate to Canada. Then I find a tutor from Taobao which is a very well-known e-commerce platform. I regret it later because that teacher's English ability is so bad, he even made several grammar mistakes. I find several other tutors after that, but all of them are not satisfy my requirements. Until one day my old friend called me and recommended me a tutor, that tutor's English is really good, and not only that, her teaching ability is also good, I learn English from her since then.
In conclusion, I strongly believe that maintaining friendships with a few people for happiness is more important than making many new friends. This is because long-term friends are more familiar with you and old friends are more trustworthy.
