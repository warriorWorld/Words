Most people in the world think that it was easier to identify what type of career or job would lead to a secure, successful future in the past. Personally, I agree with this claim. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.
To begin with, the world is changing in a much more rapid way nowadays than in the past. today, a lot of things are unimaginable decades ago, such as AI, AI drawing, auto-drive, etc. My personal experience is a compelling example of this. I am an Android developer, when I was a child, there is no Android, no iOs, and even no mobile phone. But today, there are billions of Android devices all around the world, not just mobile phones, but also all kinds of devices, such as TVs, PDAs, etc. Technology's evolution is a good thing, but it also means career unstable for individuals. Mobile phone evolution makes a lot of camera producers, MP3 producers, and MP4 producers lose their jobs.  
Secondly, in the past, countries are much more independent in economics than today. Independent economic means people can focus on their job without worrying about other countries' competitiveness. For instance, today's workers must face low-price and low-human-right competitiveness coming from China, you know, those Chinese work 6 days per week and 12 hours per day, and they have no rights to protect themselves from this kind of tyranny. Because of this, a lot of people lose their jobs.
In conclusion, I strongly believe that today, people could not easily predict if their careers will succeed or not. This is because today's technological development is much faster than in the past, and today's global economy is bound together and this makes a lot of underdevelopment countries into the competitive game.
