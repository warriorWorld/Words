Most people in the world nowadays think that movies and television are poisoning our new generation. However, personally, I think that movies and television are beneficial to young people rather than detrimental to them. I think this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.
First of all, streaming media can bring families together, a lot of movies are suitable for family members to watch together. And watching movies together strengthens family bonds, and this is especially important for young people who are in puberty. My personal experience is a compelling example of this. About five years ago, when I still am a teenager. I was very rebelling at that time, and someday, a movie called "Up" was on. My family went to that show together, and we were both touched by that movie, which tells us a story about long-term family love. Thanks to that my family relationship get better and better since then. My example demonstrates how a movie can improve people's relationships.
Secondly, there are many movies that are educationally good for young people, such as documentaries. Studying is critically important, especially for new generations who live in a competitive era. Documentaries cover a vivid variety of subjects, such as science, society, and animals. For example, two years ago, I purchased the "Curiosity Stream" service, which is a very well-known documentary website service. Since then I watched a lot of all kinds of documentaries, and I have not only studied a lot of specific subjects knowledge but also I learned English very well through this. This instance demonstrates how documentaries could improve one's ability in varieties things.
In conclusion, I strongly believe that movies and television are beneficial for young people. This is because streaming media can make families bond together, and movies such as documentaries can bring knowledge to young people.
