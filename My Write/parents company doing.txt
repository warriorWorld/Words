Due to today's competitive society, many people believe that parents should spend their not so much leisure time educating their children. In my opinion, parents should spend that time having fun with their children rather than educating them. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.
To begin with, little company time with your children will damage their mental health, let alone if that time is used to educate them. This kind of utilitarianism will destroy your children in the end. In my country, there are a lot of these kinds of examples. Hengshui high school is a very well-known school in my country. This school implements military management, and it rigidly regular literally every minute of its students' behaviors, such as when to wake up, when to eat, when to sleep, etc. In addition, in this school, students only have one day off per month. If parents use this one day time off to do things related to schoolwork, needless to say, how much damage this will cause to the students. Unfortunately, this is a reality in my country, and actually, there is a rumor said that about ten students commit suicide in that very school every year.
Secondly, having fun with your children such as games and sports can help to develop children's interest in something. My friend's also my schoolmate's experience is a compelling example of this. When he was little, his father always play with him whenever his father have the time, they play LOL and DOTA together. When he grow up he already developed a strong interest in e-sports, and today he already is a member of LDL.
In conclusion, I strongly believe that parents should spend their not much leisure time with their children on fun things. this is because children who grow up with no love will have mental health issues, and children who spend time on fun things can help children develop interests.
