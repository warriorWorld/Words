In my opinion, I strongly agree with Andrew's idea that teenagers should focus on learning. I would add that usually, teenagers are very busy studying, they don't have enough time to do part-time jobs. My personal experience is a compelling example of this, When I was 16 years old, I had a lot of subjects I needed to learn, I had to learn 16 hours a day, and even during weekends, I had to study too. You know, in my country, that is very normal. I don't think when I was 16 years old, I had the time doing part-time jobs.
Claire raised the relevant point that teenagers can learn time management from doing part-time jobs, but she didn't mention that teenagers can also learn time management from managing their studying time.
Overall, then, I would say that is why I don't agree with the statement that students should do part-time jobs.
