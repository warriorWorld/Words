In my opinion, I agree with the statement that along with technology's development, people will no longer need cinemas in order to enjoy films. I feel this way for several reasons.
To begin with, with VR technology, people can actually watch movies on bigger screens, this is because VR devices can provide people with virtual screens which can be extremely big compared to actual screens.
Secondly, I think if people want to watch movies together with others they can also use VR devices in order to do so. People can build  virtual cinemas in VR devices, you know, in the future, that is possible.
And finally, watching movies in physical cinemas is very expensive compared to watching movies online. And also, watching movies online is much more convenient than watching movies in a cinema, you can watch a movie while you are using a toilet.
