In my opinion, I strongly agree with Jack's idea that a lot of people, especially teenagers would purchase products that influencers have recommended, but some influencers are not trustworthy. I would add that even if those influencers are not intentionally deceiving their fans, they are still not trustworthy. This is because, as I know, most influencers are not experts, but because they need people's attention, they would set foot in those majors that they don't understand very well. For example, several years ago, Bitcoin was really popular, and as a result, a lot of influencers crowded into this topic. And since I am a programmer, I had a rather deep understanding on this topic, during that time, I found that most influencers didn't even know what a Bitcoin is, but they still had the willingness to discuss this topic.
Overall, I'd say that influencers definitely have the ability to convince young people buying something. But they are not trustworthy.
