Personally, I think if my government wants me to live in a rural area, the government should provide me with a proper job. And since I am an Android developer, you know, in rural areas, it is extremely difficult to find a job that is related to programming. And I believe that most people in my country don't want to live in rural areas because they cannot find a well-paid job. You know, most people actually love to live in their hometowns, and in my country, most people's hometowns are in rural areas. And also, usually, rural areas' environments are better than cities'. In addition, I agree with Kelly's idea that the government should give people enough entertainment facilities in rural areas in order to attract more people.
In conclusion, I believe the most important thing that a government should do if they want to attract people to live in rural areas is provide enough well-paid jobs for people.
