In my opinion, I strongly believe that we should prioritize the environment. I agree with Alex's idea that a well-protected environment will bring us health and happiness. I would add that sometimes protecting the environment efforts even have economical benefits. For example, beavers love to build dams, by doing so, they can slow down the river stream. And slow downed rivers will help us preserve underground water. In contrast, without beavers' efforts, we have to spend a lot of money to save our underground water.
Maggie raised the relevant point that some companies might eventually develop new technologies that solve our environmental issues, but she doesn't mention that companies usually don't have the motivation to do that. I mean, companies are profit-oriented.
Overall, then, I'd say that protecting the environment is much more important than developing the economy.
