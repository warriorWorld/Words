In my opinion, I strongly agree with Jack's idea that online classes make education more accessible by making students who don't have the condition of studying on site have the opportunity to take classes. I would add that online classes can also make foreign countries' people access classes in America become possible, such as me. You know, I always watch documentaries on the Curiosity Stream, and I learnt a lot of things from the website. In addition, online classes are extremely convenient, you can actually take a class while you are using a toilet. And also, online classes are usually very cheap, this makes those underdeveloped countries' people accessing those high-quality classes become possible.
I don't agree with Emily's idea that online classes make people learn less. I believe if students really have the willingness to study, they will study well, whether they are taking an online class or a physical class.
