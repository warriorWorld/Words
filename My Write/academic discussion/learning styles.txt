In my opinion, I strongly agree with Rachel's idea that discussions can help students understand challenging topics, I would add that teenagers usually easily feel sleepy during classes, especially when the class is very boring, such as when the professor or teacher only teaches the topic by lecture. I believe this is because when people are learning passively, they will feel bored easily, but when they are learning actively, they will not. As a result, they most likely will not fall asleep during classes when they discuss topics.
Mike raised the relevant point that students cannot take notes during discussions, but he didn't mention that most people will not reread their notes. Actually, I have made a lot of notes, but I haven't reread them even once, and that is why I stopped taking notes.
