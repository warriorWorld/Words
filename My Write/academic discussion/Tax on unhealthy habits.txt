In my opinion, governments shouldn't tax unhealthy foods, I strongly agree with Tanya's idea that even government taxed unhealthy foods, people would still eat them nonetheless. I would add that people should take responsibility for their own health. We shouldn't expect governments to take every single responsibility for us, that will make governments too powerful and it will be detrimental to our democracy. 
Secondly, Sam raised the relevant point that governments could use that money for promoting healthy eating habits. But he didn't mention that there are no monitors in some countries, such as my country, my country people have no human rights at all, let alone the right to monitor the government.
Overall, then, I'd say that we mustn't allow any governments interrupt our habits. honor for freedom!
