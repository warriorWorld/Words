In my opinion, nowadays government services are much more accessible than in the past, I strongly agree with John's idea that government services have been performing an important role in terms of people's longevity. I would add that in the past, a lot of people died because of war or conflict between areas. Compared to the past, nowadays, only a few countries still suffer from war. Personally, I think democracy can help reduce conflict in a country dramatically. And I think that's why today we have a much more peaceful world compared to one hundred years ago.
Lisa raised the relevant point that breakthroughs in modern medicine benefit our health a lot. But she didn't mention that not everyone has the money to do organ transplantation, actually, most of us don't have that much money, especially people who live in a developing country.
