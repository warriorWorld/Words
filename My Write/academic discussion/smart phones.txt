In my opinion, I strongly agree with Mike's idea that modern technology benefits our societies by making people communicate with each other more frequently become possible. I would add that because of smart phones, we can now discuss things with millions of people together, you know, most of those people are strangers to you. We can discuss policies, games, movies and TV shows together, in this way, people can develop a lot of new understandings. In addition, I believe smart phones have also provided us chances to communicate with our family members more frequently, you know, if you have to talk with your family members face to face, you may have only several chances to meet them in one year, but with smart phones, you can talk with them whenever you want, and wherever you want.
Rachel raised the relevant point that talking face to face has more depth compared to communicating with smart phones, but she didn't mention if we have to talk face to face, then we will barely have the chance to do so.
