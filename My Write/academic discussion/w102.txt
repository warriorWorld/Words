In my opinion, I strongly agree with Andrew's idea that tourism is a way that can propagate a culture. I would add that most remote areas are usually very poor, and tourism can provide local people with a lot of money. You know, in my country, there are a lot of places that are very suitable for tourism, but because the transportation of those areas is usually underdeveloped, they cannot apply tourism. In other words, I think if the government can invest money in the transportation system in those areas, people will become richer .
Claire raised a relevant point that governments should build factories in those locations, but she didn't mention that factories and agriculture could damage environments, and also, those areas are usually hard to commute.
