In my opinion, I strongly agree with Mike's idea that targeted advertising is ethical.
I would add that targeted advertising sometimes is convenient for customers. My personal experience is a compelling example of this, half a year ago, when I was watching a documentary, there is an advertising advertise a website which is focused on documentaries called "Curiosity Stream". I bought its service, and I found it really helpful for me to learn lots of knowledge. Without targeted advertising, I could miss that brilliant website.
Jessica raised the relevant point that they can create high-quality ads that appeal to a broad audience, but she didn't mentions that customers usually don't want to buy something not because the advertising is badly performed but because they have no interest in that product.
Overall, then, I'd say that targeted advertising is beneficial to both advertisers and customers.
