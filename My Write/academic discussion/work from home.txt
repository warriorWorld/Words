In my opinion, I strongly agree with Michael's idea that remote works can make employees harder to get promotions. I would add that remote work also makes your bosses and leaders more doubtful about your hard work. They may think that you are not working hard enough and always ask for your progress in your work. My personal experience is a compelling example of this. You know, because of the COVID-19 lockdown, I have to work at home for four weeks, and during that time, my leader asks me at least five times per day about the progress of my work. You know, this is really annoying. And also, some issues we must discuss face to face, otherwise, you cannot solve those problems very well.
Sara raised the relevant point that when we work from home we will not be disturbed by colleagues, but she didn't mention that when we work from home we may be disturbed by family members.
