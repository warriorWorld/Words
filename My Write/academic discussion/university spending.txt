In my opinion, I think universities should consider spending their precious funding a little more on sports compared to before. I strongly agree with Mike's idea that sports can bring the campus community together. I would add that most universities already spend a lot of money on libraries.
Rachel raised the relevant point that libraries are essential for universities and for students. But she didn't mention that sports could also benefit students' health. And a healthy body could assist a student learning well at school. For example, when I was still a student, I always fell asleep in classes because of my lack of exercise. But after I played basketball a lot, I barely fell asleep in classes anymore.
