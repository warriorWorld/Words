In my opinion, I strongly agree with Paul's idea that field trips sometimes can trigger children's willingness to study more. I would add that field trips can also make students truly understand what they have learnt. My personal experience is a compelling example of this. When I was a kid, I cannot understand why teachers always said farmers were usually very tired until I went on a field trip. During that trip, I saw how farmers really work, and because of this I had a deep understanding of farming.
Kelly raised the relevant point that a field trip is a waste of time and teachers should spend more time on instruction. But she didn't mention that most time, instruction is very boring, especially for children. You know, if you just talk without letting students see how things really work, soon, they will fall asleep.
