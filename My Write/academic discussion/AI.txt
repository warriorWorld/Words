In my opinion, I think, ultimately, AI will benefit our society rather than harming our society. I strongly agree with David's idea that AI will solve many of our society's problems. I'd add that AI also could do a lot of jobs that are too boring for humans.
Megan raised the relevant point that AI will make a lot of people lose their jobs, but she didn't mention that AI also will create a lot of new jobs for us, such as AI developer, AI marker, etc.
Overall, then, I'd say that AI is irreplaceable for humankind, and will eventually benefit human beings.
