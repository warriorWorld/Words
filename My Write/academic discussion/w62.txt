In my opinion, I strongly agree with Kelly's idea that by providing ongoing training companies can make their employees stay loyal to them. I would add that ongoing training can also make employees meet the new requirements of the company's new demands. You know, sometimes, along with a company's development, there will be new skills that require employees to have. My personal experience is a compelling example of this, about three years ago, my company suddenly needed to develop a game. But you know, I am an Android developer, not a game developer. As a result, my company provided me with an opportunity to study game development. And after three months of studying, I already have the ability to develop a simple game. After that, I completed the game project.
Andrew raised the relevant point that a company should hire the most skilled workers, but he didn't mention that sometimes, a company's demands for an employee may change.
