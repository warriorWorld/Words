In my opinion, I strongly agree with Claire's idea that optional attendance is good for students and as long as students can learn what they are supposed to learn, it will be good. I would add that sometimes, students' professions are even better than their professors, especially in those majors such as computer science and mathematics. As a result, I think if a university requires those students to attend classes, it will be a waste of talent. In addition, you know, even though some professors are professional at their major, they are not good at education. This is actually a very common phenomenon.
Andrew raised the relevant point that class attendance is important because it can teach students discipline. But he didn't mention that students who have discipline are usually very weak in their profession or in other words, they usually lack talent.
