In my opinion, governments should give their people the right to speak freely and the right to have media. You know, in my country, there are no human rights but labor abuse, there is no media but propaganda. I really hope that one day I can speak freely in my country without the fear of being arrested, I really hope that one day I can watch news that is not faked by the government, and I really hope that one day people in my country don't need to work overtime anymore. You know, that is why today I am here for a TOEFL exam, because what my country or my government cannot provide me, other countries or other governments can, I want to go to a foreign country in order to get what I suppose to have or what every human is supposed to have from the beginning.
