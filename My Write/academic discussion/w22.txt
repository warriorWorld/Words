In my opinion, I strongly agree with Kelly's idea that professors or teachers should only give grades based on students' performance. I would add that a lot of students love to cater to their professors and act as if they have tried very hard on assignments. In other words, if professors give them grades based on how hard they've tried on their assignments, then I think the professors have been deceived by their students.
Paul raised the relevant point that one person can do hard work means they can better apply for a job, but he didn't mention that sometimes this kind of hard work can only be seen as a lack of working or studying abilities.
Overall, I'd say that professors should put more concerns on students' performance compared to their hard work.
