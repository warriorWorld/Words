In my opinion, I strongly agree with Lila's idea that grades are needless and created an environment that would be detrimental to students mental health. I would add that in reality, things are much more complex, and we cannot merely value someone just by his or her grades.
Jake raised the relevant point that grades are the only way to evaluate someone, and when students go to the real world, they will also be judged by their performance, but he didn't mention that people are too sophisticated to evaluate and there are a lot of aspects about a person. For example, can you say someone is bad just by his grades even if he did a lot of good things to society?
