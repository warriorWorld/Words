In my opinion, I agree with Mark's idea that social media improved our society, I'd add that social media also assists scientists more readily to collect a lot of data, that was extremely difficult to achieve in the past.
Sarah raised the relevant point that a lot of people had suffered anonymous bullies from the internet. but she didn't mention that people also gained a lot of anonymous encouragement and help from social media. For example, nowadays, there are a lot of anonymous donation websites that aid a lot of people to overcome their hard times.
Overall, then, I'd say that social networks are more helpful than harmful to our society.
