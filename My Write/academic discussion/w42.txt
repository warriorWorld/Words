In my opinion, I agree with Andrew's idea that a gap year is a good chance for students to confirm their plans for university. I would add that a gap year is also a good opportunity for students to think about their future, think about what they want to do. My personal example is a compelling example of this, about five years ago, when I entered the university for one year, my major was civil engineering. I felt so tired, and I took a gap year for that reason, then after a year's thinking, I realized that I really don't like civil engineering, and then I decided changing my major to computer science. Nowadays, I am already an Android developer, and I love my job because I love coding.
Claire raised the relevant point that gap years are a waste of money, but she didn't mention that you can actually earn money during your gap year.
