The reading and the lecture are both about saving frog populations. While the author provided three solutions related to this, the lecturer disputes the claims mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the article claims we should prohibit pesticide use in the frog population area. However, the lecturer casts doubt on this claim. She says that prohibiting farmers from using pesticides in a specific area will make those farmers lose their competitive ability to the other farmers, which is economically impossible.
Secondly, the author of the reading says that we can use medicines to cure frogs who are affected by fungus disease. On the other hand, the lecturer disputes this argument, she says that using medicines to cure frogs means we have to cure each frog and each generation of the frog, and that makes it impossible to implement.
Finally, the author of the article thinks that we should protect frog habitats by prohibiting human activities in that area. this argument was challenged by the lecturer, she mentions that global warming is the real threat to frog habitats, and prohibiting human activities in that area will not prevent global warming, thus is no use to protect the frog habitats.
