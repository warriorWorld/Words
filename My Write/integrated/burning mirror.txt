The reading and lecture are both about whether or not the  burning mirror is merely a myth. While the author of the passage thinks that the burning mirror is just a myth, the lecturer, however, disputes all of the claims mentioned in the reading.
To begin with, the author of the article suggests that Greeks were unable to build such a device in technical terms. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this claim by saying that even Greeks cannot build a parabola shape with a single mirror, but they could build it with a dozen mirrors.
Secondly, the author of the reading thinks that the burning mirror would take too much time to start a fire on a boat, let alone the boat have to stop there without moving. By contrast, the lecturer rebutted this argument by stating that Greeks could aim other staff such as the material that was used for the ship's waterproof protection. This material only takes seconds to burn.
Finally, the author of the article says that Greeks already had flaming arrows, so they seemingly do not need a weapon such as the burning mirror. However, the lecturer casts doubt on this idea, she mentioned that the enemies of Greeks are already very familiar with the flaming arrows, so they would have prepared when they confronted with them. But the burning mirror worked like magic, and this will surprise the enemies of the Greeks.
