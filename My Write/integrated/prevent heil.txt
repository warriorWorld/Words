The reading and the lecture are both about using cloud seeding to prevent hail damage's feasibility. While the author of the reading thinks that it is feasible. However, the lecturer disputes all of the arguments mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the article claims that cloud seeding is already a success in the laboratory environment. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this claim by saying that it is true that cloud seeding succeeded in a laboratory environment, but in reality, the cloud seeding technique can prevent any kind of precipitation such as snow, rain, and hail. As a result, this technique may lead to drought in the area.
Secondly, the author of the reading says that there are already several successful cloud seeding usage examples in Asia. However, the lecturer rebutted this argument by saying that those succeeded instances are all in the city areas, not rural areas. And compared to rural areas, city areas have much more pollution, and that pollution can benefit cloud seeding's success.
Finally, the author of the reading thinks that many local studies have shown that cloud seeding is beneficial to farming. In contrast, the lecturer casts doubt on this claim, she says that those areas near the area which used the cloud seeding also have less crop damage. This indicates that it is not cloud seeding's influence but other natural variations.
