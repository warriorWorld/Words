The reading and the lecture are both about whether or not Robert E. Peary succeeded in reaching the North Pole on April 7, 1909. While the author of the passage thinks that Robert E. Peary did succeed in this task. The lecturer, however, disputed all of the claims mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the reading mentioned that the National Geographic Society's committee proved Robert E. Peary's success. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this argument by stating that the committee and Robert E. Peary are close friends, and the committee have even given a lot of money to Robert E. Peary. In addition, they just took two days with the investigation. In other words, they are not objective.
Secondly, the author of the article says that a British explorer succeeded in the task in 37 days with the same equipment that Robert E. Peary used. And he thinks this could prove Robert E. Peary also succeeded. The lecturer casts doubt on this claim, she says that even though their equipment was the same, the British explorer dropped his food half way in order to lose his carrying weight, and the weather he experienced was much better than Robert E. Peary's. 
Finally, the author of the passage claims that Robert E. Peary's photo's shadow proved that Robert E. Peary indeed went to the North Pole successfully. However, the lecturer rebutted this argument by saying that to prove the picture's validity, we need the image to be very precise. But Robert E. Peary's photo was taken one hundred years ago, and it is very blurry and faded right now. Thus we cannot accurately say whether the photo is valid or not.
