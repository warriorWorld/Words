The reading and the lecture are both about whether or not a painting was made by Rembrandt, while the author of the article believes that the painting was not painted by Rembrandt and provided three reasons trying to prove it, the lecturer, however, disputes all of the claims mentioned in the passage.
To begin with, the author of the reading mentioned that the painting's subject wears a kind of cloth that only servants would wear, but simultaneously she also wears a luxurious fur collar. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this claim by stating that recently, researchers have found that the painting was modified by someone else, and the fur collar was added by this person in order to increase the price of the painting about one hundred years after the painting was made.
Secondly, the author of the article believes that the light on the painting is not right, he further mentioned Rembrandt would not make such a mistake. By contrast, the lecturer casts doubt on this, she says that after researchers removed the previously mentioned cover layer, they found out that the original collar that the subject wearing is a light color collar. 
Finally, the author of the passage thinks that the glued panel proved the painting being fake. However, the lecturer rebutted this argument by saying that the glued panel was also added by someone who wanted to increase the value of the painting by enlarging the painting. In addition, she mentioned the guled panel was made from the same tree of the painting's panel.
