The reading and the lecture are both about archaeology in the United Kindom. While the author of the passage mentioned three issues related to archaeology in the UK, the lecturer, however, disputes all of the claims mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the reading states that the growth of Britain's population along with the growth of constructions in Britain has caused a lot of trouble for archaeologists. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this claim by saying that since the 1990s the UK has published a new regulation that has helped archaeological inductory a lot. For example, the law regulates every construction before construction must be examined first, if it has archaeological value it will be excavated and documented by the government and local experts.
Secondly, the author of the article believes that the pay of archaeologists is very low in the UK. By contrast, the lecturer casts doubt on this claim, she says since the 1990s the payment of archaeologists will be paid by construction companies not by government.
Finally, the author of the passage mentioned that the jobs related to archaeology are extremely small in number. However, the lecturer rebutted this argument by stating that since the 1990s construction companies have provided a lot of all kinds of jobs related to archaeology at all stages of archaeological excavation, such as making plans before excavation, processing the excavation, and preserving the things that have excavated.
