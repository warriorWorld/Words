The reading and the lecture are both about whether or not a certain kind of device will work when against desertification. While the author of the passage provided three reasons why the device will not work when fighting against desertification, the lecturer, however, disputes all of the claims mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the reading believes that 25 US dollars is too expensive for growing trees. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this argument by stating that even if the device costs 25 dollars, it can be reused  twenty times or more. 
Secondly, the author of the article considers that people who really need those devices are extremely poor and he thinks that they wouldn't want to use those devices because they don't have enough energy to do other things compared to survive. By contrast, the lecturer casts doubt on this, she says that those devices can be used for other purposes such as collecting water for other plants. They can grow their food using the device. In addition, those tree branches can be used as fire wood for local people.
Finally, the author of the passage mentioned that when trees outgrown the device, trees have to confront the harsh environment on their own, and they may not be able to survive. However, the lecturer rebutted this argument by saying that the device helps trees grow long roots, and with those long roots trees can survive in the harsh environment. According to some data, 90 percent of trees that used those devices survived for at least two years.
