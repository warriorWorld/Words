The reading and the lecture are both about whether or not bees existed as early as 200 million years ago on Earth. While the author of the reading argues that bees don't exist at that time, the lecturer disputes all of the claims mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the reading says that no actual bees fossil have ever been found that date to 200 million years ago. On the other hand, the lecturer says that it is true that we never found any bees fossil that dates to 200 million years ago, but that may be due to lacking the trees that can preserve bees' body by their liquid at that time.
 Secondly, the author of the article thinks that since today's bees feed almost exclusively on flowers, and 200 million years ago, there were no flowering plants at all, thus there must no bees existed at that time. However, the lecturer disputes this claim by saying that by that time bees could feed on non-flower plants such as fir or fine trees.
Finally, the author of the article claims that fossilized bees' nests which date from 200 million years ago's structures are different from modern bees' nest structures in detail. In addition, he thinks that the nests may be made by other insects. The lecturer challenged this argument by saying that today's bees' nests and 200 million years bees' nests actually have the same waterproof chemical.
