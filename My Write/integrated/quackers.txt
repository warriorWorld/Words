The reading and the lecture are both about where the quackers come from. While the author of the reading provided three theories about the quackers, the lecturer, however, disputes all of the theories mentioned by the article.
To begin with, the author of the passage suggests the sounds may come from orca whales while they are mating. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this argument by saying that orca whales are commonly active near the surface of the sea, but submarines usually patrol near the bottom of the ocean. Obviously, humans can hear sounds from that far. In addition, if that sounds come from orca whales, then those ocar whales would already have been detected submarines' sonar.
Secondly, the author of the reading says that the sounds may come from giant squids. By contrast, the lecturer disputes this claim, she said that people started hearing the sounds from the 1960s, and stopped hearing them in the 1980s. But simultaneously, giant squids exist all the time. There is no way people suddenly cannot hear the squid sounds.
Finally, the author of the article thinks that the sounds may come from other countries' submarines. However, the lecturer rebutted this theory by saying that submarines cannot move that quickly, and even nowadays, submarines still cannot be silent, they surely will have engine noise.
