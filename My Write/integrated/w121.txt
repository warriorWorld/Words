The reading and the lecture are both about whether or not a professionally painted portrait is a portrait of Jane Austen's. While the author of the reading provided three reasons why the portrait is a portrait of Jane Austen's, the lecturer, however, disputes all of the claims mentioned in the passage.
To begin with, the author of the passage mentioned that Austen's family has already acknowledged the portrait as a portrait of Jane Austen's. On the other hand, the lecturer rebutted this argument by stating that when Austen's family acknowledges the portrait, Austen herself had already died for 17 years. As a result, most of Austen's family members at that time had never seen Austen in person.
Secondly, the author of the article believes that the portrait is very similar to a sketch of Austen's, the faces resemble each other. By contrast, the lecturer challenged this claim by saying that the Austen's family is an extremely large family, as a result, there are a lot of family members that  are the same age during certain period and they also have similar faces. The lecturer suggests that the portrait is a portrait of a distant relative of Austen's.
Finally, the author of the reading mentioned that the portrait's date and the age of Austen at that time proved the portrait's authority. However, the lecturer casts doubt on this, she says that the businessman who sold the paper which the portrait painted on began his business when Austen was already 27 years old. So, it is unlikely the portrait is a portrait of Austen's.
