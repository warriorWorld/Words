The reading and the lecture are both about preventing birds from getting hurt when encountering glass buildings. While the author of the reading provided three solutions to this problem, the lecturer disputes all of the advice mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the article advises us to build buildings with one-way glass, and he thinks this will prevent birds try to through it. However, the lecturer casts doubt on this claim. He says that if you see a one-way glass from outside a building, it looks like a mirror. And a mirror is as bad as glass because if a mirror reflected the sky or a tree, birds will recognize it as the sky or a tree, and then try to through it.
Secondly, the author of the reading argues that we can use colorful designs such as thin stripes to cover glass. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this argument by saying that if you really want to use colorful thin stripes to cover glass, you must make sure that the stripes' spaces are extremely small, otherwise birds will think they are holes and try to fly through them.
Finally, the author of the article claims that we can use a magnetic field to guide birds to avoid buildings. The lecturer rebutted this claim by saying that birds only use the magnetic field to navigate long distances and if they are only trying to fly from one city to another, they will not use it.
