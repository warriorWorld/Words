The lecture and the reading are both about whether or not certain photographic negatives are made by Ansel Adams. While the author of the article believes that the photographic negatives are made by Ansel Adams and provided three reasons to prove his belief, the lecturer, however, disputes all of the claims mentioned in the passage.
To begin with, the author of the reading mentioned a certain pine tree leaning downward on a cliff in the negatives, and he mentioned that the tree has also appeared in Adams' other photographs. As a conclusion, he believes that the photographic negatives are made by Adams. By contrast, the lecturer casts doubt on this, he says that the tree is not a random tree but a very famous pine tree in the park. As a result, a lot of photographers have taken photos of the pine tree.
Secondly, the author of the article believes that the marks on the envelopes holding the photographic  negatives are written by Virginia Adams, Ansel Adams' wife. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this argument by stating that the marks have actually been spelled wrong of the park's name. And then the lecturer mentioned that Virginia Adams was extremely familiar with the park, thus, it's unlikely she would spell an incorrect name of the park.
Finally, the author of the passage mentioned that the negatives have fire damage is consistent with one of Adams works' accident. However, the lecturer rebutted this claim by saying that around the 1920s, taking photographs was dangerous, because they need to use a kind of very dangerous chemical, the chemical is very easy on fire. As a result, a lot of negatives at that time were damaged by fire.
