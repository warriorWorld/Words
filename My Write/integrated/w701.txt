The reading and the lecture are both about whether or not growing palm trees is good for the environment and our societies. While the author of the article provided three reasons why he believes that palm trees have benefits for both our environments and our societies, the lecturer, however, disputes all of the claims mentioned in the passage.
To begin with, the author of the reading believes that because palm trees can produce more oil compared to other crops, as a result, we can grow fewer palm trees in order to get the same volumes of oil. By contrast, the lecturer casts doubt on this, she says that people love palm oil, and because of this desire, farmers have  actually grown more and more palm trees  in recent years in order to satisfy the demand of the market. As a consequence, this actually has increased deforestation.
Secondly, the author of the article mentioned that palm oil can work as a kind of fuel for automobiles and it can reduce the volume of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this argument by stating that in order to grow those palm trees, farmers have to clear land by burning them. As a result, this actually has increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
Finally, the author of the passage considers that growing palm trees could benefit small-scale farmers. However, the lecturer rebutted this claim by saying that only at first, small-scale farmers can own their own fields of palm trees. But not long    those large companies will get control of those fields from small-scale farmers. In the end those small-scale farmers can only get little returns from palm trees.
