The reading and the lecture are both about the little ice age's cause. While the author of the passage provided three theories explains how the little ice age formed. However, the lecturer disputes all of the claims mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the reading states that melted glaciers may  contribute to global climate change. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this argument by saying that scientists found that the Gulf Stream only affected the north of the planet's climate, the south of the earth's climate remains not affected at that time. Thus this theory cannot explain why the south of the earth's temperature also dropped significantly in the period.
Secondly, the author of the article provided a theory that volcanic clouds may cause global temperature drops at that time. By contrast, the lecturer rebutted this theory by stating that volcanic clouds cover the earth would be extremely visible to humans, such as colorful skies. But there is not a single report about this at the time.
Finally, the author of the passage thinks that the human population dropping may let the forest have time to grow and absorb a lot of carbon dioxide. However, the lecturer casts doubt on this argument by saying that the human population recovered quickly at that time, and the forest didn't have enough time to affect the climate enough to cause the little ice age.
