The reading and the lecture are both about how to protect the golden frog population from certain fungus infection. While the author of the passage provided three solutions in order to deal with this, the lecturer, however, disputes all of the solutions mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the reading suggests we inject a type of bacterium into golden frogs, the bacterium can produce a kind of chemical which can deal with the fungi. By contrast, the lecturer casts doubt on this, she says that the bacterium can only produce the chemical for a very short time, it cannot last very long, and soon, it will stop producing the chemical.
Secondly, the author of the passage believes that we can breed golden frogs in captivity and then release them in the wild in order to replenish wild populations. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this argument by stating that the new population which is bred in this way will not stay healthy for a long time as long as they enter the wild. This is because in the wild, there are a lot of other kinds of animals who have the same disease, as a result, this new population of golden frogs will be infected by those animals.
Finally, the author of the article thinks that golden frogs' natural defense could help themselves to conquer the disease. However, the lecturer rebutted this claim by saying that those golden frogs who used the increasing heat to deal with the infection may consume a lot of energy and become too weak. As a consequence, they may die from other causes.
