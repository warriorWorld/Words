The reading and the lecture are both about whether or not some solutions about how to deal with the yellow crazy ant will work. While the author of the article provided three methods of how to destroy the yellow crazy ant population on an island, the lecturer, however, disputes all of the means mentioned in the passage.
To begin with, the author of the reading suggests using a kind of toxic to the ants, and he mentioned this kind of toxic has succeeded in other locations, such as an island near Australia. By contrast, the lecturer casts doubt on this, she says that the toxic will kill other species of ants, such as the native ants on the island, because the toxic cannot differentiate between ant species. In addition, she mentioned why the toxic has succeeded near Australia, it is because there are no native ant species that exist on the island near Australia.
Secondly, the author of the article mentioned the yellow crazy ants live on broad-leaved trees, and he considers that we can cut those trees down because the broad-leaved trees are also not native species. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this argument by stating that the yellow crazy ants actually prefer several types of habitats and one of them is open areas that have enough sunlight. And if we cut down those trees, we will create an ideal place for those ants to live.
Finally, the author of the passage believes that human constructions and human activities have helped to increase the yellow crazy ant population. And we should reduce human activities on the island. However, the lecturer rebutted this by saying that it will cause huge economic reductions on the island, because people on the island rely on the travelers to earn money. In addition, a lot of scientists need to go to the island in order to research the unique trees on the island.
