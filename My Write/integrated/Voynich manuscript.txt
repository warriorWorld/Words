The reading and the lecture are both about where the Voynich manuscript coming from. While the author of the reading provides three theories about this. However, the lecturer disputes all of the claims mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the reading suggests that the Voynich manuscript is Anthony Ascham used to record some magical subject and scientific findings in secret code. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this argument by saying that Anthony Ascham is just an ordinary botanist, and all his record source is not from himself, it is not original. Therefore, it is no need for him to record that knowledge in secret code.
Secondly, the author of the article says that the Voynich manuscript may be faked by Edward Kelley who lived in the sixteenth century. By contrast, the lecturer rebutted this claim by saying that it is true Edward Kelley faked a lot of things, but the rich people who lived in the sixteenth century are very easy to fool, therefore, Edward Kelley is no need to make that manuscript so sophisticated in order to make money.
Finally, the author of the reading thinks that the Voynich manuscript may be a modern fake by Wilfrid M. Voynich himself. However, the lecturer casts doubt on this claim, he says that the Voynich manuscript's ink dated to four-hundred years ago. Wilfrid Voynich maybe could find a vellum dated from four-hundred years ago, but where can he find a bottle of ink that dated that long ago?
