The reading and the lecture are both about how to help Torreya trees survive. While the author of the passage provided three solutions in the reading, the lecturer, however, disputes all of the solutions mentioned in the passage.
To begin with, the author of the article believes we could replant Torreya in the northern part of Florida in order to rescue them. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this argument by stating that Torreya is a kind of tree that inhabits places that are cool and moist. But due to climate change, the northern part of Florida is already too hot and dry for Torreya.
Secondly, the author of the reading states that we could move Torreya to forests that are further north than Florida. By contrast, the lecturer rebutted this claim by mentioning that scientists have already done something similar to this, but the result was horrible. They planted black lucas trees in a forest and those trees spread extremely fast, as a result, a lot of local trees died because of this, and among those dead local trees some are also very rare.
Finally, the author of the passage suggests that we could preserve Torreya in research centers in order to ensure the continued survival of Torreya. However, the lecturer casts doubt on this suggestion, she says that we must guarantee the gene-diversity of one species in order to assist the species to resist diseases. But with the laboratory environment, we cannot do that.
