The reading and the lecture are both about why the 52-hertz whale sounds so different compared to other whales. While the author of the passage provided three theories explaining why, the lecturer, however, disputes all of the claims mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the reading considers that the 52-hertz whale is a hybrid. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this argument by stating that all the hybrid whales would still travel along with other whales when they migrate. In other words, hybrid whales have the same migration pattern compared to normal whales. But the 52-hertz whale was traveling alone when scientists found it.
Secondly, the author of the passage thinks that the 52-hertz whale may be a deaf whale. By contrast, the lecturer casts doubt on this, she says that to be able to make a sound with that high-pitch, the whale must have an unusual throat, otherwise, it cannot produce such a high-pitch sound. In other words, the fact that a whale cannot hear a thing will not make the whale have the ability to produce such a sound.
Finally, the author of the article believes that the 52-hertz whale may be a rare species whale. However, the lecturer rebutted this claim by saying that even a rare species whale has its own parents, and if the 52-hertz whale is a rare species whale, then its parents should also have the ability to produce such sound, but scientists only found this one who can produce such high-pitch sound.
