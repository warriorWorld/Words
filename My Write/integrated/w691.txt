The reading and the lecture are both about whether or not the cave paintings of Lascaux were made to ensure  successful hunting. While the author of the article provided three reasons why he believes that the paintings were made to ensure a successful hunt, the lecturer, however, disputes all of the claims mentioned in the passage.
To begin with, the author of the reading believes that the animal subjects of the paintings were all those animals that Paleolithic people would hunt. By contrast, the lecturer casts doubt on this, he says that many animals that have appeared on the paintings were not Paleolithic people's prey, such as cats and rhinoceros. In addition, reindeer was the most popular prey at that time, but reindeer has not been painted by them at all.
Secondly, the author of the article mentioned some depictions of humans with animal heads, and claims that they were hunters who used this method in order to disguise themselves. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this argument by stating that those figures are not even standing, most likely they are sleeping.
Finally, the author of the passage thinks that the paintings work as a kind of magic which can help ancient people to hunt more successfully. However, the lecturer rebutted this claim by saying that Paleolithic people indeed believe that those paintings have a kind of magic, but not all magic is for hunting. For example, ancient people considered that their ancestor souls live in those animals, and maybe they drew those paintings in order to commemorate their ancestors.
