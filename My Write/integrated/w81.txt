The reading and the lecture are both about the authenticity of the Chevalier memoir. While the author of the reading provided three reasons why the Chevalier  memoir is fake in a lot of details, the lecturer disputes all of the claims mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the passage considers Chevalier was poor because he had borrowed a lot of money from others. By contrast, the lecturer casts doubt on this, she says that having a lot of loans doesn't mean that one person is poor, because businessmen need to sell their products in order to actually gain their money, and sometimes they need to borrow money from others.
Secondly, the author of the reading believes that Chevalier  cannot accurately recall his conversations after years. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this argument by stating that Chevalier has a habit of taking notes after he has a conversation with others. And Chevalier's friend who once lived with Chevalier had confirmed this fact.
Finally, the author of the article doesn't believe that Chevalier can actually escape from the prison just by a piece of metal, and he thinks Chevalier must escape the jail by some of his friends who work for the government's help. However, the lecturer rebutted this claim by saying that the prison has a lot of other people who have more powerful friends but they all failed to escape. And also, after Chevalier's escape, the government repaired the ceiling of the prison, the ceiling that Chevalier claimed he destroyed when he was escaping.
