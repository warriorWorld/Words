The reading and the lecture are both about whether or not we should keep the "let it burn" policy any more. While the author of the passage provided three reasons why we should shut down the policy. The lecturer, however, disputes all of the claims mentioned in the reading.
To begin with, the author of the article mentioned that Yellowstone has lost a tremendous number of trees and vegetation due to fires. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this claim by mentioning that despite Yellowstone having lost a lot of trees and vegetation, but only in this way, a lot of new plants could have opportunities to thrive, especially those small plants. In addition, she mentioned a kind of plant that can only germinate at a high level temperature. And she also mentioned that after the fires Yellowstone actually has a more diverse plant species.
Secondly, the author of the reading mentioned that wildlife was also affected by the Yellowstone fires. However, the lecturer rebutted this by stating that animals also have new opportunities because of these fires. For instance, the fires provided hares and rabbits with new habitats, and the animals who eat rabbits and hares also could benefit from the fires.
Finally, the author of the passage believes that the fires have caused the park a lot of detrimental in terms of economics. By contrast, the lecturer casts doubt on this, she says that the fires in that year are actually extremely rare. The low rainfall, the strong wind all of this have not occurred since then.
