The reading and the lecture are both about what function the lambeosaur's crest serves. While the author of the article provided three theories about the function of the lambeosaurs' crest, the lecturer, however, disputes all of the theories mentioned in the passage.
To begin with, the author of the reading thinks that the crests may work as an organ for smelling. This  is because the crest has a similar structure characterized by a high density of blood vessels. By contrast, the lecturer casts doubt on this, he says that in order to smell, the animal's brain needs to be well developed, but the Lambeosaur brain cavity was very small.
Secondly, the author of the article believes that the lambeosaur's crest may serve as an organ for cooling. He mentioned that other animals such as stegosaurs were also cooling themselves by their increased body surface area. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this argument by stating that stegosaurs actually have a lot of bony places in order to cool themselves, but the lambeosaur only had one crest and the crest was so small for cooling.
Finally, the author of the passage considers that the crest may be used as an organ for making sound, and lambeosaurs may use the crests to communicate with each other. However, the lecturer rebutted this claim by saying that in order to communicate, animals need to be good at hearing, but right now, there is only one kind of lambeosaurs that have the evidence that can prove them have good hearing abilities, and other kinds of lambeosaurs don't have this kind of evidence.
