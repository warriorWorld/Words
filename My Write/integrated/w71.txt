The reading and the lecture are both about whether or not ecocertification will work in the United States. While the author of the passage provided three reasons why the ecocetification will not work in the American market, the lecturer disputes all of the claims mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the reading believes that American consumers don't care about ecocertification because there are a lot of similar advertisements available in markets. On the other hand, the lecturer casts doubt on this, he says that US customers treat advertisements differently. In the US, customers would trust independent organizations more, and the ecocertification is started by an international organization.
Secondly, the author of the article thinks that ecocertificated wood will be more expensive than uncertified wood, and consumers will choose the cheaper ones. By contrast, the lecturer challenged this argument by saying that customers only care about the prices when the prices are too high or too low, and if the prices only have five percent difference or lower than five percent difference, they wouldn't care about the prices.
Finally, the author of the passage mentioned that the American wood companies have their business mainly in the United States, they don't concern foreign markets. However, the lecturer rebutted this claim by stating that American wood companies maybe don't concern foreign markets, but they are extremely caring about the foreign wood producers competition, if they don't catch the trend of the world, the foreign wood producers may crowd into American markets.
