The reading and the lecture are both about theories about some carved stone balls' purposes that were found in Scotland. While the author of the passage provided three theories about the stone balls' meaning. The lecturer, however, disputes all of the theories mentioned in the reading.
To begin with, the author of the article claims that the carved stone balls may be used as weapons. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this claim by stating that if the carved stone balls were used as weapons, then they must have worn out or some of them definitely would have been cracked, and now being pieces. But instead, most of the carved stone balls nowadays are well-perseved.
Secondly, the author of the reading thinks that since the carved stone balls are similar in size, they may be used as measurements of weight. By contrast, the lecturer casts doubt on this argument by saying that the carved stone balls are different in density, as a result, even though they are similar in size, they weigh differently.
Finally, the author of the passage argues that the carved stone balls may be used as marks of social status of the owners. The lecturer, however, disagrees with this theory, she says that the carved stone balls' designs are inconsistent, some of them have extremely intricacy patterns,  and some others are very simple in design. In addition, people in that period generally would bury their possessions with them when they die, but there is no evidence of such buries of the carved stone balls.
