The reading and the lecture discussed the main cause of the otter population decline in the areas along the western coast of North America. While the author of the reading suggests pollution is the main reason why the otter population has declined along the western coast of North America, the lecturer, however, disputed all of the claims mentioned in the article and suggests the predation is the main cause of the decline.
To begin with, the author of the passage mentioned there are a lot of pollution sources along the coast. By contrast, the lecturer challenged this argument by stating that no one has found  any dead otters along the western coast of North America yet. And she believes that this proved the predation theory, because those bodies of otter have been eaten by predators.
Secondly, the author of the reading believes that orcas don't eat small animals such as otters. On the other hand, the lecturer casts doubt on this, she says that a lot of human hunters have caused the decline of a lot of other animal populations, and this leads to less and less food source being available for orcas. As a result, orcas may start eating otters instead.
Finally, the author of the article mentioned that the decline of sea otter population is not even in areas, and he thinks this proved the pollution theory. However, the lecturer rebutted this claim by saying that the uneven decline proved the predation theory, because orcas cannot enter the shallow waters, they can only predate in the deep waters. And the data shows that in the shallow water areas, no significant decline of otter population has happened.
