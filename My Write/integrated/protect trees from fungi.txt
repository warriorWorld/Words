The reading and the lecture are both about protecting trees especially oak trees from P. ramorum. While the author of the reading provides three solutions for this issue. However, the lecturer disputes all of the claims mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the article says that P. ramourum spores are spread by humans through their shoes or bicycle tires. On the other hand, the lecturer casts doubt on this claim by saying that P. ramourum only spread a tiny percent of its spores by humans, they spread their spores mainly by water, first, rains bring spores into river streams, then, river streams spread the spores all around the forest.
Secondly, the author of the reading claims that we can use fungicidal to control the P. ramorum infect trees. The lecturer challenged this argument by saying that fungicidal can only effects for a few months. In addition, she said that this method could only help a few oak trees, but there is a whole forest waiting to be rescued, and using fungicidal on a whole forest every few months is not practical.
Finally, the author suggests that we cut the infected area of the tree and vegetations of the tree's surrounding area. The lecturer rebutted this claim by saying that it would destroy a lot of healthy and precious plants.
