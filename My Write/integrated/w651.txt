The reading and the lecture are both about whether or not tuna farming is feasible. While the author of the reading provided three reasons why tuna farming is not feasible, the lecturer, however, disputes all the claims mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the passage mentioned that female tuna do not lay eggs in captivity, as a result farmers have to catch young wild tuna in order to raise them. By contrast, the lecturer casts doubt on this, she says that scientists have found a method that can make female tuna lay eggs even in captivity by injecting some kind of hormone. As a result, farmers no longer need to catch wild tuna anymore.
Secondly, the author of the article believes that tuna have to eat a lot of fish every day in order to get protein that they need. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this argument by stating that a lot kinds of plants contain an extreme volume of protein, and tuna can eat them instead of fish. In addition those plants are very cheap compared to fish.
Finally, the author of the reading mentioned that tuna confined to ocean cages are likely infested with parasites. However, the lecturer rebutted this by saying that scientists have found that if you put the cages in the deep ocean, the parasite problem will be solved. This is because those parasites can only live in shallow water.
