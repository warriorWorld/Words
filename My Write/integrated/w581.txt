The reading and the lecture are both about whether or not some of the stories of Spartacus' are true. While the author of the passage provides three stories and believes those stories are true, the lecturer, however, disputes all of the claims mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the reading claims that Spartacus' original goal was going home. By contrast, the lecturer casts doubt on this, she says that going home is not Spartacus' only goal. She mentioned that Spartacus once had cleared a route to his and his soldiers' home. But he didn't return home at that time, by contrast, he went to city Rome and looted a lot of valuables from there, in other words, his goal was wealth.
Secondly, the author of the article thinks that Spartacus had used fewer people winning an enemy who had many more soldiers than he had. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this argument by stating that at first, Spartacus' enemy didn't take him seriously and they only sent soldiers who only  have poor equipment and with little experience. And the lecturer mentioned when Spartacus' enemy paid enough attention to him, Spartacus was defeated several times.
Finally, the author of the passage considers Spartacus a person who wants to release slaves. However, the lecturer rebutted this claim by saying that there is no evidence that can prove this claim, and Europeans themselves used slaves as a human resource. In addition, in the 18th century a certain group needed a hero who frees slaves, so they made a play that showed that Spartacus had released slaves, but this play is not based on true history.
