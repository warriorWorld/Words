The reading and the lecture are both about how to deal with cheatgrass in North American. While the author of the article provided three solutions on how to solve this problem, the lecturer, however, disputes all of the solutions mentioned in the passage.
To begin with, the author of the reading suggests we encourage some animals such as cattle to feed on the grass. By contrast, the lecturer casts doubt on this, she says that cows or other animals who eat grass preferring other kinds of grass instead of the cheatgrass, they will eat other kinds of grass first, and only eat a little of the cheatgrass. As a result, the kinds of grass that people want to protect will be damaged far more than cheatgrass.
Secondly, the author of the article mentioned that cheatgrass is highly flammable, thus, we can burn them in order to control their population. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this argument by stating that this will only destroy the surface of the cheatgrass, but those seeds that underground will still be alive, and they can survive for years. After the fire, those seeds will germinate without difficulty.
Finally, the author of the passage believes that we can use a kind of fungus which can prevent the growth of cheatgrass. However, the lecturer rebutted this claim by saying that those fungi and the cheatgrass have lived together for thousands of years, the cheatgrass has already developed resistance toward the fungi. Nowadays, those fungi can only harm the weak or the sick ones of the cheatgrass.
