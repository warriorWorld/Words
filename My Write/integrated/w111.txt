The reading and the lecture are both about whether or not the fact that today's young people reading less and less literature is detrimental to our societies. While the author of the passage provided three reasons why this would damage our societies, the lecturer disputed all of the claims mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the reading believes that nothing else provides the intellectual stimulation that literature does. By contrast, the lecturer casts doubt on this, she mentioned that all those scientific, historical, political books are high-quality and can stimulate young people's intelligence.
Secondly, the author of the passage considers literature is deep and the others are superficial. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this argument by stating that every era has its own art styles and forms, there are a lot kinds of art that are very profound such as music and movies and can you say that those art forms are low in culture standard?
Finally, the author of the article thinks that a lot of talented authors have been harmed by the fact that nowadays only a few people would read literature. However, the lecturer rebutted this idea by saying that it is those authors' fault to make the literature too hard to understand.
