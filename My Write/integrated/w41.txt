The reading and the lecture are both about whether or not dinosaurs were endotherms, while the author of the article believes that more and more evidence has shown that dinosaurs were indeed endotherms, the lecturer, however, disputes all of the claims mentioned in the passage.
To begin with, the author of the reading thinks that those polar dinosaur fossils proved that dinosaurs were endotherms because only endotherms can live in such a cold environment. By contrast, the lecturer challenged this argument by stating that those polar areas during those dinosaurs' living period were very warm and when those areas became cold, those dinosaurs may have migrated to somewhere else or they may hibernate during cold period like today's reptiles.
Secondly, the author of the article mentioned dinosaurs had similar leg positions just like nowadays' endotherms and believes this can prove dinosaurs were endotherms. On the other hand, the lecturer casts doubt on this, she says that having similar leg positions doesn't mean that dinosaurs were endotherms. In addition, she believes dinosaurs can easily support their weight if they put their legs under their bodies since dinosaurs usually were very big, and the big bodies provided big advantages with dinosaurs.
Finally, the author of the passage believes that a kind of bone structure which is called haversian canal can prove dinosaurs were endotherms. However, the lecturer rebutted this claim by saying that dinosaurs' bone rings showed that they grow very slowly during cold weather and grow very fast during warm weather. But, you know, endotherms grow fast even during cold weather.
