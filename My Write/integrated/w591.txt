The reading and the lecture are both about what uses the Plain of Jars served in the past. While the author of the passage provided three theories of the purposes of the jars, the lecturer, however, disputes all of the claims mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the reading thinks that the jars may be served to make alcohol. By contrast, the lecturer challenged this argument by stating that in the past, Laos' people usually use clay jars to make alcohol, and he mentioned that it is difficult to make a jar using stones. And clay jars can make alcohol as well as stone jars. So it is unnecessary to use stone jars in order to make alcohol.
Secondly, the author of the passage believes that the jars may be used as a container of water, and they may sell water to traders who are passing by. On the other hand, the lecturer casts doubt on this, he says that the location of the jars is near a river, as a result, there is no need to do that.
Finally, the author of the article considers the jars may be tombs. However, the lecturer rebutted this theory by saying that tombs usually need to be protected from bad weather and thieves. The jars that archaeologists found have no covers on them, so it is unlikely that they are tombs.
