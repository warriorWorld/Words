The reading and the lecture are both about whether or not the 2,200 year old vessels are batteries. While the author of the reading provided three reasons suggesting that they are not batteries. The lecturer, however, disputes all of the claims mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the passage states that there were no wires that have been found on the site. On the other hand, the lecturer rebutted this argument by telling that the vessels were found by local people, not trained individuals. Therefore, it is possible that they didn't recognize the value of the wires, and simply threw them away.
Secondly, the author of the reading believes that the vessels are similar to some scroll containers, and he thinks that the vessels must also be some kind of scroll containers. By contrast, the lecturer challenged this claim by stating that it is possible that the vessels indeed were scroll containers, but the people at that time suddenly realized that the vessels also could use to generate electricity.
Finally, the author of the article thinks that due to lack of devices which rely on electricity the vessels certainly are not batteries. However, the lecturer casts doubt on this theory by saying that people can feel an electricity shock from the vessels, because of this, they may consider the vessels have invisible power. In addition, they may use electricity for healing purposes or just use it to convince others that they have super power.
