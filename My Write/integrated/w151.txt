The reading and the lecture are both about how to control the cane toad population in Australia. While the author of the passage provided three solutions to restrict the cane toad population. The lecturer, however, disputes all of the solutions mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the reading suggests the Australian government building  fences that can prevent cane toad from passing. On the other hand, the lecturer casts doubt on this by saying that the young toads actually can cross fences by rivers to the other side of the rivers and only a few young toads can establish an entire community of cane toad.
Secondly, the author of the passage suggests the Australian government hire some volunteers to catch those cane toads, especially those young cane toads and the eggs of the cane toad. By contrast, the lecturer rebutted this claim by stating that those untrained individuals cannot distinguish the cane toads from the other toads and frogs, especially those young frogs and toads. They would destroy a lot of precious and rare frogs and toads.
Finally, the author of the reading believes that the Australian government can utilize some viruses which would only work on the cane toads in order to control their population. However, the lecturer challenged this argument by saying that the virus actually can do harm to the American cane toads who are a kind of native species in the US by illegal transportation. And those cane toads in South America are a vital part of the ecosystem.
