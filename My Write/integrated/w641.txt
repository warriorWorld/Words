The reading and the lecture are both about whether or not East Coast Broccoli is good for our societies. While the author of the article provided three reasons why he believes that East Coast Broccoli will benefit consumers, the lecturer, however, disputes all of the claims mentioned in the passage.
To begin with, the author of the passage claims that the lower transportation costs will make East Coast Broccoli cheaper than previous ones. By contrast, the lecturer casts doubt on this, she says that even though the transportation costs indeed are decreased, the environment of the East Coast will make the yield of the Broccoli very low compared to California Broccoli. As a result, this factor will cancel out the price advantage.
Secondly, the author of the reading believes that customers will love to purchase East Coast Broccoli because East Coast Broccoli is not a kind of genetically modified crop. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this argument by stating that since the Broccoli company has used a lot of genetic modification technology on their other products, customers may not believe them, and reject their products.
Finally, the author of the passage mentioned that East Coast Broccoli has more nutrients and vitamins, and he believes that consumers will love to hear that. However, the lecturer rebutted this by saying that customers could buy other vegetables if they want more nutrients or vitamins. Then she mentioned a kind of vegetable which has better nutrients and vitamins compared to East Coast Broccoli.
