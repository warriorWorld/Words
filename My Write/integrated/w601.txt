The reading and the lecture are both about whether or not some protecting rhinoceros strategies will work. While the author of the passage provided three methods which he believes can protect rhinoceroses, the lecturer, however, disputes all of the strategies mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the reading believes that we can dehorn rhinoceroses in order to protect them from poachers. By contrast, the lecturer challenged this claim by stating that rhinoceroses who lose their horns cannot survive in the wild well. This is because they need their horns digging for water, finding food and protecting their young.
Secondly, the author of the passage considers that the government could educate their people to learn that the rhinoceros horns are not valuable for medical use. On the other hand, the lecturer casts doubt on this, she says that those people who believe in that the rhinoceros horns having medical uses have a very strong culture base, they believe in this for thousands of years. As a result, the government is unlikely being able to change this belief.
Finally, the author of the article suggests that the government sell their rhinoceros horns in order to decrease the rhinoceros horn prices. However, the lecturer rebutted this argument by saying that if the government start to sell their rhinoceros horns on the market, some customers who didn't buy any rhinoceros horns may start buying rhinoceros horns because those horns are legal. As a result, the rhinoceros horn market would expand dramatically, and the prices would increase too. And then more poachers would appear because the prices have increased.
