The lecture and the reading are both about whether or not the four-day workweek will benefit our societies, while the author of the passage provided three reasons why this strategy is good for our communities, the lecturer, however, disputes all of the claims mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the reading believes those companies which applied for this strategy can hire more employees without the needing to spend more money. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this argument by stating that companies have to train their employees and provide medical services for their employees. But those costs will not reduce even if they apply the four-day workweek strategy. In addition, companies have to prepare more offices and computers for their additional employees.
Secondly, the author of the passage thinks that the unemployment rates will be reduced if a lot of companies apply this strategy. By contrast, the lecturer casts doubt on this, he says that as he mentioned, hiring a new employee costs the company a lot of money, and because of this, the company may expect its employees doing more jobs compared to the past. And also, those companies which applied to this strategy may order their employees to work overtime. As a result, the four-day workweek will not reduce the unemployment rates but will make employees unhappy.
Finally, the author of the article considers those employees who work only four days per week will have more leisure time compared to others. However, the lecturer rebutted this claim by saying that those employees who work four days per week may lose their jobs first during a bad economical period, because their work abilities are worse than others. Besides, companies will most likely make those employees who work five days per week to be a leader.
