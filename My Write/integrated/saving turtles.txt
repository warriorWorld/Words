The reading and the lecture are both about saving sea turtles. While the author of the reading thinks that the turtle excluder device is not a good solution for saving sea turtles. However, the lecturer disputes all the claims mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the reading says that one shrimp boat only accidentally catches one turtle per month, in comparison, the TED cost is too high compared to its benefits. On the other hand, the lecturer rebutted this argument by saying that it is true that one shrimp boat only caught one turtle per month by accident, but there are thousands of shrimp boats out there on the ocean. That means every year there are thousands of sea turtles are caught by incidents and that is a big problem.
Secondly, the author of the article thinks that we can limit the duration of the shrimp nets in the water, he thinks this method can prevent sea turtles from being drowned. By contrast, the lecturer casts doubt on this claim, she says that it is difficult to enforce this rule, because monitoring every shrimp boat on the sea and counting the time is impossible.
Finally, the author of the reading claims that TED is too small and a lot of kinds of sea turtles are very big, and they cannot escape from TED. However, the lecturer agrees with this claim, but she adds that the large version of TED is already in production, and there will be no problem in that version of TED to let the large turtles escape.
