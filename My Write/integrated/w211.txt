The reading and the lecture are both about whether or not genetically modified trees are good for our society. While the author of the passage provided three reasons why genetically modified trees are good for us. The lecturer, however, disputes all of the claims mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the passage states that genetically modified trees are hardier than natural trees. By contrast, the lecturer challenged this argument by saying that natural trees have much more gene-diversity than genetically modified trees, and if a disaster happened, some of them could survive. But the genetically modified trees are designed for just certain viruses, and they are uniform in terms of genetics, if a disaster occurred, and the disaster were not the ones which the trees are designed for, those trees will all be wiped out.
Secondly, the author of the reading believes that genetically modified trees can bring farmers a lot of economic benefits. On the other hand, the lecturer rebutted this by mentioning that the seeds of the genetically modified tree prices are much higher than natural one prices. And not only that, farmers are not allowed to collect genetically modified seeds even if the seeds are made from their own plants, and this is regulated by law. They must pay for the seeds whenever they plant them.
Finally, the author of the article says that we can plant genetically modified trees in forests in order to benefit our environmental condition. However, the lecturer casts doubt on this claim, she says that genetically modified trees are more aggressive compared to natural trees, and they will out-compete the natural trees for sunlight and water.
