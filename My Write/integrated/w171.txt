The reading and the lecture are both about whether or not bird population will decrease continuously in the future. While the author of the passage thinks bird population will drop and provides three reasons for this point. The lecturer, however, disputes all of the reasons mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the reading states that buildings and cities have caused birds losing their habitats. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this argument by saying that although some kinds of bird indeed have lost their habitats, other species of bird actually increased their habitats because of cities and buildings, such as sea gulls, pigeons, and even falcons increased their population because they can eat seagulls and pigeons.
Secondly, the author of the article mentioned that agricultural activities could harm bird population, and the areas that it is used for agriculture will increase continuously. By contrast, the lecturer rebutted this claim by stating that every year the land used for agricultural purposes is decreased, at least in the United States it is so. This is due to new kinds of crops that require less land and can yield more in the same size of land, which have appeared on the horizon.
Finally, the author of the passage thinks that pesticides will kill more birds in the future. However, the lecturer casts doubt on this statement, she says that today, a lot of new kinds of pesticide have appeared, and they are less toxic compared to before. In addition, new crops that are resistant to pests have also been introduced by scientists, and they are harmless to birds.
