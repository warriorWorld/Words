The reading and the lecture are both about what caused the transient lunar phenomena or in short, what caused TLP. While the author of the article provided three theories and tried to explain the causes of TLP, the lecturer, however, disputes all of the theories mentioned in the passage.
To begin with, the author of the reading believes that some optical instruments should be blamed, he thinks those optical instruments' flaws caused TLP. By contrast, the lecturer challenged this argument by stating that if TLP is caused by flaws of optical instruments, then all of the TLP should also happen at random places on the moon, but, in reality, TLP happened at specific locations.
Secondly, the author of the article mentioned meteors striking may be the reason why people have observed TLP. On the other hand, the lecturer casts doubt on this, he says that if TLP is made by meteors, then it should only last for one second, but, actually, some TLP can last for twenty minutes. And it is not likely that TLP is caused by several meteors, because the TLP that people observed did not happen during meteor showers.
Finally, the author of the passage thinks that TLP may be caused by  thermoluminescence, and he mentioned the Moon actually contains rocks that can generate light. However, the lecturer rebutted this claim by saying that the thermoluminescence light is too weak compared to the Moon light which is reflected from the Sun. As a result, people cannot see it.
