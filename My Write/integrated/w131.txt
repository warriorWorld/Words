The reading and the lecture are both about whether or not allowing individuals trading fossils is good for scientific research. While the author of the passage provided three reasons why it will damage the science community, the lecturer, however, disputed all of the claims mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the reading mentioned that fossil trading makes the public lose their accessibility to fossils and leads to the public losing interest in fossils. By contrast, the lecturer challenged this argument by stating that the exposure of fossils actually increased because of this. This is because a lot of schools will routinely purchase fossils and exhibit them to the public.
Secondly, the author of the article believes the science community will lose a lot of opportunities to research new find fossils. On the other hand, the lecturer casts doubt on this, she mentioned that by the law every new find fossils must be examined by scientists before they enter the market, and those scientists would determine whether or not the fossils are valuable in terms of science.
Finally, the author of the passage states that untrained people usually don't pay attention to how fossils lie on the ground even though that information is really important to scientists. However, the lecturer rebutted this idea by saying that if we prevent individuals from trading fossils, there would be many fewer fossils being discovered. As a result, scientists would have even less data they can research on compared to now.
