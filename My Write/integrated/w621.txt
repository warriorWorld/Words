The reading and the lecture are both about whether or not artificial reefs are good for our societies. While the author of the passage provided three reasons why artificial reefs can benefit our communities, the lecturer, however, disputes all of the claims mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the reading believes that artificial reefs can help the fish population grow. By contrast, the lecturer casts doubt on this, he says that the overall fish population will not increase because of the use of artificial reefs. This is because artificial reefs only attract fish, as a result, a lot of fish is concentrated in one place and are caught by fishermen. As a consequence, the overall fish population will drop instead of increasing.
Secondly, the author of the article thinks that those small-scale fishers can benefit from this, because they can build their own artificial reefs without publishing their locations. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this claim by stating that it is extremely dangerous doing things like that. This is because those fishers' nets could destroy reefs, and also artificial reefs in the shallow water could damage boats by being crashed by boats.
Finally, the author of the passage considers that we can use artificial reefs as a means of recycling. However, the lecturer rebutted this argument by saying that even if dangerous chemicals were removed from the materials they would still be detrimental to the environment. The lecturer mentioned an event where the artificial reef crashed because of a storm and damaged a lot of precious ocean animals and plants.
