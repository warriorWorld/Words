The reading and the lecture are both about whether or not Amtrak should be owned by the United States government. While the author of the reading provided three reasons why he thinks that the United States government should sell the Amtrak to private companies, the lecturer, however, disputes all of the claims mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the passage considers that Amtrak has wasted a lot of money on those unpopular lines, maybe hundreds of millions of dollars per year. By contrast, the lecturer challenged this argument by stating that Amtrak's main purpose is not to make money but provide transportation services for people, especially those people who don't have so many means of travel. She believes that those people also have the right to travel.
Secondly, the author of the article thinks that it is unfair to compensate Amtrak so much money and without compensate others, such as the airline companies. On the other hand, the lecturer casts doubt on this, she says that it is silly to claim that airline companies didn't receive money from the government. She mentioned that the US government has built towers for airline companies and trained employees for them for so long.
Finally, the author of the reading believes that the US government should spend money on the highway rather than railroads, because people love to use the highway compared to railroads. However, the lecturer rebutted this claim by saying that people love to use highways because the government hasn't spent a lot of money on the railroads, as a result, the trains are too slow compared to other countries' trains such as Japan's and Eurpe's. She believes that the government should spend more money on railroads, and in the future, more and more people will prefer to use the railroads as a means to travel.
