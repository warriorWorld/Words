The reading and the lecture are both about whether or not airships are better than airplanes and helicopters. While the author of the article provided three advantages that airships have, the lecturer, however, disputes all of the claims mentioned in the passage.
To begin with, the author of the passage believes that since airships don't need to lift themselves by engines, they are more economical in the fuel costs compared to airplanes and helicopters. By contrast, the lecturer casts doubt on this, he says that airships usually use hydrogen or helium in order to lift themselves from Earth. But using hydrogen is extremely dangerous, it has already caused a lot of tragedies. On the other hand, although helium is safer than hydrogen, helium is expensive and the lift power it can provide is limited compared to hydrogen. 
Secondly, the author of the article considers that we can use airships to replace helicopters to carry heavy loads such as logs from forests. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this argument by stating that airships are really large, and it is very difficult for them to stay steady especially when the weather is windy. This fact  makes them vulnerable to trees.
Finally, the author of the reading thinks that airships could help carry satellites into Earth's orbit. However, the lecturer rebutted this claim by saying that when the airship arrives at the height of 14 kilometers, it will be extremely windy at that height. As a result the airship must use a lot of fuel and refuel itself several times in order to stay in the location. This makes the trip very expensive.
