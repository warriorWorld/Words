The reading and the lecture are both about whether or not electronic medical record systems are beneficial for our society. While the author of the reading thinks that it is a good idea to save medical data in electronic form, the lecturer challenged all of the author's claims.
To begin with, the author of the reading says that electronic medical record systems can save money by reducing storing and transferring of paper medical records. On the other hand, the lecturer disputes this claim by mentioning that doctors will still store paper medical records for legal and backup reasons.
Secondly, the author of the article thinks that electronic medical records can prevent errors because they can standardize medical records forms and can prevent errors made by handwriting. However, the lecturer challenged this claim by saying that doctors will still take notes by hand and then some other staff will enter the info into computers, thus errors made by handwriting will still exist.
Finally, the author of the reading claims that electronic medical records will help researchers analyze medical data because electronic data is much more collectible than paper data. this argument is rebutted by the lecturer, she says that electronic medical records are not easy to access because private law prohibits researchers to access them, and if you really want to access those data, you not only need permissions from the government but also need permissions from each patient.
