The reading and lecture are both about whether or not edmontosaurus migrate to the south every winter. While the author of the passage provides three arguments suggest they did migrating to the south every winter. The lecturer, however, disputes all the claims mentioned in the passage.
To begin with, the author of the reading states that since edmontosaurs only eat plants, there were no plants during winter on Alaska's North Slope. This indicates edmontosaurus must migrate to the south regularly. By contrast, the lecturer challenged this claim by saying that during the time in which edmontosaurus were living, Alaska's North Slope was a lot warmer than today. And at that time, there were twenty hours of daylight per day during summer, this means plants at that time were growing very well. And during winter, there still were a lot of dead plants that could feed for edmontosaurus.
Secondly, the author of the article believes that because edmontosaurus lived in herd, they definitely have migration habits. On the other hand, the lecturer rebutted this argument by saying that animals living in herd in order to protect themselves from predators, living in herd doesn't mean they migrate regularly. In addition, the lecturer provided an example of a kind of animal who lives in herd without migration habits.
Finally, the author of the passage says that edmontosaurs were capable of migrating long distances. However, the lecturer casts doubt on this claim. She says it is true that the adults of edmontosaurs were capable of migration, but the young edmontosaurus weren't capable of migration, they would slow down the herd, and they didn't have the ability to live on their own.
