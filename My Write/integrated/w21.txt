The lecture and the reading are both about whether or not group workings can be more productive compared to individual  workings, while the author of the article believes that group workings are advancer than individual workings and provided with three reasons, the lecturer, however, disputes all of the claims mentioned in the passage.
To begin with, the author of the reading thinks that a group of people has a wider range of resources and it can work more quickly than individuals. By contrast, the lecturer challenged this argument by stating that a company did an experiment about this, and at the end of the experiment, they found that a lot of people in the group have taken free rides, they didn't contribute at all. In addition, the real contributor complained about the project.
Secondly, the author of the article thinks that people in a group can take more risks because their responsibility will be taken by everyone. On the other hand, the lecturer casts doubt on this, he says that there was an influencer who made a plan, and the plan eventually failed, although there was someone who opposed the plan, people just think it is everyone's responsibility that the plan has failed.
Finally, the author of the passage believes that people can get more rewards from a group working. However, the lecturer rebutted this claim by saying that some groups take a very long period of time in order to reach a consensus and in the end they didn't succeed at all.
