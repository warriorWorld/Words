The reading and the lecture are both about the cause of a mass extinction that happened at the end of the Triassic. While the author of the reading provides three possibilities for this mass extinction, however, the lecturer disputes all of the arguments mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the reading thinks that the drop of the sea level maybe leads to the mass extinction. The lecturer, however, says that it is possible that ocean level drop may lead to the mass extinction, but it will only happen when the drop happened rapidly. In contrast, evidence suggests the drop of the sea level happened gradually at that time.
Secondly, The author of the article says that the rise of sulfur dioxide cause global climate cooling may lead to mass extinction. The lecturer challenged this argument by saying that the rise of sulfur dioxide cause global climate cooling will only happen if the rise happened rapidly, otherwise, the So2 will be absorbed by water and clear out.
Finally, the author of the reading thinks that an asteroid strike may cause the mass extinction. The lecturer rebutted this claim by mentioning that there is no evidence of this kind of strike. And actually, there is an evidence of asteroid strike, but it happened before the extinction about two hundred million years ago.
