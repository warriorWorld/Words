The reading and the lecture are both about theories of the Steller's sea cow's extinction. While the author of the reading provides three theories of the extinction. The lecturer, however, disputes all of the theories mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the reading thinks that the sea cows may be overhunted by native people for eating. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this claim by saying that the Steller's sea cow's body was usually length nine meters long, and weighs ten tons. Just a Steller's sea cow can provide a group of native people with one month's food. In addition, he mentioned that the native groups usually are very small. 
Secondly, the author of the article says that climate change may lead to kelps decline and kelps are the main food for the sea cows. In contrast, the lecturer casts doubt on this argument, he says that it is unlikely that dramatic climate change occurred at that time. Because if that is true, then all other plants and animals will also have been affected. But there is no evidence, such as whales' decline, that supported the change.
Finally, the author of the reading mentioned that the sea cows may be overhunted by the European fur traders who killed the last one of the sea cows. However, the lecturer rebutted this argument by saying that the sea cows' extinction occurred soon after the European fur traders arrived. When they arrived, the number of sea cows was already very small. So it is unlikely the sea cows' extinction was caused by them.
