The reading and the lecture are both about whether or not online encyclopedias are good for our societies. While the author of the passage provided three reasons why online encyclopedias are bad for our communities, the lecturer, however, disputes all of the claims mentioned in the reading.
To begin with, the author of the article believes that the contributors to online encyclopedias usually lack professional backgrounds. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this argument by stating that online encyclopedias could change their content any time, and by contrast, printed encyclopedias cannot do that, sometimes, they remained their errors for decades.
Secondly, the author of the passage considers that online encyclopedias are vulnerable to hackers. By contrast, the lecturer casts doubt on this, she mentioned that in order to protect their content online encyclopedias have made their critical information read-only and hire some people to monitor some important information in order to protect it.
Finally, the author of the reading thinks that online encyclopedia contents are so wide in range and too focused on some he considered trivial things. However, the lecturer rebutted this claim by saying that traditional encyclopedias only have limited space for their content, as a result, they have to select those content they considered important. But online encyclopedias don't have this limitation, this is a big advantage. This allows them to include information that people are really concerned about and also increases the diversity of information.
