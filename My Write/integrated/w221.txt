The reading and the lecture are both about whether or not ethanol fuel can replace gasoline as energy resources. While the author of the reading provided three reasons why ethanol  cannot be the alternative of gasoline. The lecturer, however, disputes all of the reasons mentioned in the passage.
To begin with, the author of the passage says that ethanol also discharges carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this argument by stating that despite ethanol discharges CO2, but in order to produce ethanol, we have to plant a lot of plants. And plants can absorb carbon dioxide from the air.
Secondly, the author of the article believes that ethanol production would require a lot of places which originally were for animal food production. By contrast, the lecturer rebutted this claim by saying that ethanol production uses the plant parts which are not edible for animals, which makes there no need for additional land to produce ethanol.
Finally, the author of the reading states that the prices of ethanol are much higher than gasoline's if there are no governments involved in the prices. However, the lecturer casts doubt on this idea, he says that today's high prices of ethanol are caused by small production scale of ethanol. In addition, he mentioned if the production scale is three times compared to nowadays, the price will drop forty percent even without tax subsidies.
