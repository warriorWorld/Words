The reading and the lecture are both about whether or not buzzing is good for our society. While the author of the passage provided three reasons why buzzing is detrimental to our community. The lecturer is also a buzzer, however, disputes all of the claims mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the reading mentioned that  buzzers praise the product only because they get paid. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this argument by stating that he buzzed the phone service only because he really thinks the service is good, not because he was paid.
Secondly, the author of the article states that since buzzers are close to customers, customers tend to believe whatever they say without any doubt. By contrast, the buzzer casts doubt on this claim, he says that in reality, it is the opposite, he mentioned people always ask him a lot of questions related to the product.
Finally, the author of the passage thinks that people will eventually lose trust in eachother because of buzzing. However, the lecturer rebutted this claim by saying that only the company that has better products can afford to hire buzzers. And with good products being introduced by buzzers, societies' trustworthiness will become better and better.
