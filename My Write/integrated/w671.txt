The reading and the lecture are both about whether or not Brendan really is the the first Europeans who arrived in North America on a voyage. While the author of the article provided three evidence and tried to convince readers that Brendan indeed succeeded in this, the lecturer, however, disputes all of the claims mentioned in the passage.
To begin with, the author of the reading mentioned that the written stories which are about how Brendan and his crew manage to travel from one place to another in order to prove his belief. By contrast, the lecturer casts doubt on this, he says that the story mentioned a lot of locations, but those locations may not be the place that the author of the reading believed. For example, an island that burn mentioned in the story may not indicate a volcano, but maybe the story actually implies that someone has set a fire on the island.
Secondly, the author of the article mentioned a ship that some researchers recently constructed which resembles a curragh and claims that the boat has succeeded in the voyage to North America. On the other hand, the lecturer challenged this argument by stating that the boat is not an exact copy of a curragh, it is actually bigger than the real one. It is 12 meters long, and because of this, its successful voyage cannot prove the feasibility of a curragh's voyage.
Finally, the author of the passage believes some marks in North America may be made by members of Brendan's crew. However, the lecturer rebutted this claim by saying that those marks may be made by native people of North America rather than some crew members of Brendan's. This is because even though some marks resemble the Irish alphabet, many others do not, and they may represent the Sun, trees and hands. In addition, the Irish alphabet only contains letters but not pictures.
