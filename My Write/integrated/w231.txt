The reading and the lecture are both about why the yellow cedars in northwestern North America have been declining continuously since one hundred years ago. While the author of the passage provided three theories related to the decline. The lecturer, however, disputes all of the theories mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the passage states that the cedar bark beetles may be the cause of the decline. On the other hand, the lecturer rebutted this argument by stating that healthy yellow cedar can secrete a kind of powerful chemical which is deadly to cedar bark beetles. In other words, cedar bark beetles can only inhabit the already dying cedar trees, those trees will be dead whether there are cedar bark beetles or not.
Secondly, the author of the reading says that bears like to eat yellow cedar barks, because they contain a lot of sugar. And he thinks  bears may be the cause of the decline. By contrast, the lecturer casts doubt on this claim, she said the yellow cedars can be found in both mainland and the surrounding islands, but bears can only be found in the mainland. In addition, the yellow cedars on the islands are also declining even though there are no bears at all.
Finally, the author of the article believes that climate change changed the yellow cedar roots growing pattern, and maybe this is the cause of the decline. However, the lecturer challenged this theory by saying that the trees in the lowland's decline ratio is higher than the highland's, even though the lowland's temperature is higher than the highland.
