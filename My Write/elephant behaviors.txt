The reading and the lecture are both about elephant behaviors. While the author of the reading claims several surprising behaviors of elephants, the lecturer disputes the claims mentioned in the article, She notes that those behaviors have other causes rather than the article claims.
According to the author of the article, elephants know they are gonna die soon, He notes that when an elephant is near its death it usually breaks away from its herd and later dies near a river, and many sites contain bodies exclusively of elderly elephants. However, the lecturer casts doubt on this argument, She says that when elephants get old their teeth condition also gets worse which makes them can only eat soft foods. And soft foods are most likely can be found near a river, which explains how elephant graveyards formed.
Secondly, the author of the reading claims that elephants seem to have artistic ability, He mentioned some elephants even can draw flowers, other elephants, and themselves. On the other hand, the lecturer challenges this argument. She says that those art elephants are controlled by a human, and she notes that elephants' ears are extremely sensitive, those human controller uses this characteristic to guide those elephants to draw specific shapes.
Finally, the author of the article puts forth that elephants fear mice, He notes that elephants fear mice more than those really dangerous animals such as lions or tigers. The lecturer rebutted this claim, she says that elephants are not fear mice but fear unfamiliar animals. She mentioned that those elephants who live in a zoo are not likely to fear mice, and those elephants who live in the wild are most likely will fear mice, the difference is whether they are familiar or not to mice.
