Most people in my country spend their life in a very rigid way, they study in their teenage, work and get married in their twenties, then raise their children, and expect their children to spend their life exactly the same way. Personly, I don't think this kind of life is worth living. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.
To begin with, in my country parents usually demand their children get married in their twenties, and according to tradition, you must have a house otherwise you have no chance get married if you are a boy. Because of this, many young people in my country have to worry about their heavy mortgages every month. Most of those people are very afraid of losing their jobs, and due to this, they usually have to obey their leaders unconditionally. My colleague's experience is a compelling example of this, he often works until 9:00 pm and works 6 days per week since he purchased his house. He once told me he is so tired every day and regrets obeying his parents' suggestion about purchasing the house.
Secondly, in my country, most people get married in their early twenties required by their parents. They rush to marriage markets just like rush to food markets, they select their partner like they select food with no emotional base but only economical base. This kind of marriage will not produce happiness but only disaster. For example, about three years ago, my classmate gets married to a girl he only meet less than a month, and only two months later, they get divorced. He once told me he barely know her, and he get married because his parents forced him to.
In conclusion, I agree societies expect young people to follow and obey are too strict nowadays, and I think they shouldn't listen to their parents. People only live once, they should live their own way.
