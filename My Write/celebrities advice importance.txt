Most young people in the world nowadays like to take advice from celebrities such as famous entertainers and athletes. In my opinion, the opinions of celebrities are neither important to younger people nor older people. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.
To begin with, celebrities such as influencers from Tiktok often give extreme advice just to get attention from people, and sometimes they even give detrimental opinions to people. In my country, there are a lot of so-called patriot influencers, and they often make comments with great bias. For example, they often defame Japan and incite hatred toward the Japanese, as a result, about ten years ago, in my country, a man attacked another man with a U-lock just because that man bought a car made in Japan. This event is very well-known in my country, but those influencers still incite Japan-hatred emotions even today.
Secondly, celebrities such as influencers from all kinds of platforms often advise on very specific subjects even though they are not experts in that subject. In addition, their followers usually are not experts either, so they just take the wrong advice with no idea that advice is absolutely wrong. For instance, about four years ago, bitcoin is a very popular topic, and everyone talks about it, including some celebrities. And since I am a programmer I know a lot of its technical details. I watched a lot of videos that those influencers made, and I found a lot of mistakes they made. I must say they don't even know what a blockchain is but they dare to comment on bitcoin with a very affirmative attitude.
In conclusion, I strongly believe that the opinions of celebrities are not worthy to take for both younger people and older people. This is because celebrities have a strong urge to give advice just to get attention from people even if they are wrong about it, and celebrities often are not experts, but they often comment on very expert areas.
