The reading and the lecture are both about taxes policies toward people's unhealthy hobbies. While the author of the article argues that governments should take high taxes on people's unhealthy hobbies such as smoking and taking unhealthy foods. The lecturer disputes the claims mentioned in the article. His position is that governments shouldn't impose high taxes on people's unhealthy behaviors.

According to the reading, the taxes can prevent people from doing unhealthy behaviors, the article mentions that raising taxes on cigarettes causes tobacco sells decline. This argument is challenged by the lecturer, He claims that high prices on cigarettes are not always lead to less smoking, it can also make purchasers buy more low-quality cigarettes, which will give more damage to smokers' bodies. Additionally, he points out that people will still buy unhealthy foods even though its price is higher than before.

Secondly, the author suggests that this kind of taxes are financially fair, the article notes that people should pay for what they did to themselves. The lecturer, however, asserts that people think fair differently, he goes on to say that most people think that taking the same amount of taxes from rich people and poor people is not fair.

Finally, the author puts forth the idea that governments can make a significant amount of money from this kind of taxes. The author contends that governments can use this money for public welfare affairs and will benefit everyone. In contrast, the lecturer's stance is this will lead to governments heavily relying on those taxes, he says that governments will build more smoke corners rather than prohibit smoking.
