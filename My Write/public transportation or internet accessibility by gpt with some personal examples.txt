As a college student, the Internet is an essential tool for my studies. During the pandemic, my classes shifted online, and I had to rely on the Internet to attend lectures, complete assignments, and communicate with my professors. However, I faced several challenges due to poor Internet connectivity in my area, which often disrupted my studies. This experience highlights the importance of improving Internet access, especially in areas with limited resources.

In contrast, I rarely use public transportation as I prefer to drive or use ride-sharing services. While public transportation is vital for some people, I believe that improving Internet access has a more significant impact on society as a whole. For example, my cousin runs a small business that relies heavily on online sales. With better Internet access, she could expand her business and reach more customers, leading to increased revenue and job creation.

Moreover, the pandemic has made telemedicine more prevalent, and my family has also benefited from it. My grandmother has several health issues, and we used to take her to the hospital regularly for checkups. However, with telemedicine, we can now consult with her doctor remotely, saving time and money. This shows how improving Internet access can have a positive impact on healthcare services.

In conclusion, these personal examples demonstrate the importance of improving Internet access over public transportation. While public transportation is still necessary for some people, improving Internet access has a broader impact on society and has several other benefits, such as job creation and improved healthcare services.
