The reading and the lecture are both about colonizing Venus's feasibility. While the author of the reading suggests that colonizing Venus is impossible, the lecturer, however, suggests that we could build a base that floats fifty kilometers above the surface of Venus, and disputes all of the claims mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the reading mentioned that Venus's atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than the Earth's, and all spacecraft that humans made can not tolerate that kind of pressure. However, the lecturer challenged this argument by saying that since we build the base above fifty kilometers from Venus's surface, that place's atmospheric pressure is much lower than the surface's pressure, and its pressure is about equal to the Earth's.
Secondly, the author of the article says that there is no oxygen and water on Venus, and transporting oxygen and water from the Earth regularly is impossible. On the other hand, the lecturer casts doubt on this claim. He says that there are a lot of kinds of chemicals in Venus's atmosphere such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and sulfuric acid, and we could use those chemicals to make water and oxygen.
Finally, the author of the article thinks that only forty percent of the sunlight can get through Venus's atmosphere to the surface, which makes using solar power cells to generate electricity not feasible. By contrast, the lecturer says that there is a lot of sunlight that can get through the place where fifty kilometers above the surface of Venus, and not only that since a lot of sunlight is reflected from below, we can actually use that sunlight which from below too.
