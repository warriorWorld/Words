It is critically important that governments improve internet accessibility nowadays, however, I think it is more important to improve public transportation than internet accessibility. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.
To begin with, well-maintained public transportation can save human life. This is because when some acute disease attack people, time means life, and well-maintained public transportation means time. My personal experience is a compelling example of this, about three years ago, when I traveled to Shanghai with my friend I suddenly got a heart attack and fainted. When I woke up I found I was in a hospital, my friend told me how he bring me here through a new build freeway and my doctor said how dangerous I am when I just got here. It is unimaginable what will happen if that freeway wasn't built at that time.
On the other hand, an advanced public transportation network means more family reunion time. This is because advanced public transportation brings people from their workplaces to their hometowns more rapidly, so they are more likely to go home more often. For example, six years ago when I just went into the workforce, there was only one local train between my hometown and my work city, and that takes me six hours each way. I only reunited with my family once a year at that time. However, about two years ago, a new bullet train line was built by the government, and that makes six hours each way to only two hours each way. Since then, I often go back to my hometown, and this year I've already reunited with my family three times. Without this bullet train, I will not have enough time to travel to my hometown so often.
In conclusion, I strongly believe that it is more important that governments spend more money to improve public transportation. This is because well-maintained public transportation can save human life, and an advanced public transportation network makes families together.
