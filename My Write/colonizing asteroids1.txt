The reading and the lecture are both about asteroid colonization. While the author of the article argues that colonizing asteroids is profitable, the lecturer disputes the claims mentioned in the reading. His position is that colonizing asteroids is not worth doing.
According to the article, asteroids' low gravity benefits landing and launching the rocket, due to this, people can carry more equipment and less fuel. However, the lecturer asserts that low gravity will damage human muscles and bones, and that is very dangerous to human health.
Secondly, the author of the reading puts forth that people can benefit by mining from asteroids, he notes that people can pay the cost with the money earned by mining. The lecturer casts doubt on this claim, he says that the colonizing's cost may be higher than the benefit, additionally, the materials' price is not guaranteed because the supply may increase dramatically.
Finally, the author of the article thinks that some asteroids are easy to reach because some of them's orbits are closer to the Earth even than the moon. On the other hand, the lecturer points out that despite some of the asteroids being close to the Earth, but then those asteroids get away from the Earth very quickly, which makes coming back to the Earth very difficult.
