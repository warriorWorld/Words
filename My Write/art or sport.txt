In my country, most people think that governments should spend more money in support of sports, which will bring honor to our country. Personally, I believe that governments should spend more money in the support of the arts. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.
To begin with, a large number of studies have shown that arts, such as music can improve your mental health. My personal experience is a compelling example of this. About six years ago, when I just enter the workforce, I was so anxious about everything, am I good enough? can I make it before the deadline? Then one day I read an article online talking about music benefits concentration and make you relax. At first, I thought that this will not that simple. However, I later bought a headset, and then listen to music while I am working. I was surprised by the effect, I was so concentrated that I even forgot lunch, and I feel very comfortable even at work. It’s imaginable that if governments don’t provide economic support to the arts, there will be much less good music in our world.
Furthermore, an art gallery as a travel destination can bring family members together and make the family bond deeper. Family members can discuss art history and simply enjoy the art itself at an art gallery. For instance, two years ago, I went to Hong Kong to work and was separated from my family since then. One year after, I read an article online talking about an art gallery opening in my hometown, and then I called my family immediately, we went to that art gallery together that weekend. That was a wonderful experience, we enjoyed together eat together just like in the good old time. It’s unimaginable that without the government’s economic support, my hometown can open such a wonderful art gallery.
In conclusion, I strongly believe that governments should support art more rather than sports. This is because arts are beneficial for mental health, and arts can bring people together.
