The reading and the lecture are both about humpback whales' migration behavior. While the author of the article thinks that humpback whales use the night sky to migrate, the lecturer casts doubt on the claims mentioned in the article.
To begin with, the author of the reading thinks that because humpback whales have highly advanced intelligence, so they must use that to navigate. However, the lecturer disputes this argument by saying that intelligence and navigation ability is not relevant, he mentions that many ducks have the ability to navigate but only have very low intelligence.
Secondly, the author of the reading says that animals that use straight lines to migrate often rely on landmarks, and there are no landmarks in the open sea, but the night sky, so humpback whales must use the night sky to navigate. On the other hand, the lecturer casts doubt on this claim, He thinks that using straight-line to migrate doesn't mean humpback whales use landmarks to navigate, he says that humpback whales have an organ that can detect the earth's magnet field, and they can use that to navigate to their destination.
Finally, the author of the article mentions that humpback whales often float straight up and look at the sky for minutes at a time, and this behavior is called spy-hopping. Additionally, he affirms that they are observing the stars up ahead. However, the lecturer challenged this claim, he says that many types of animals that have this behavior never migrate, such as sharks, which use this behavior to hunt. Additionally, the lecturer says that humpback usually spy-hopping at day time.
