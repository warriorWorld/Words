It is critically important that people make decisions on their own and collect information on their own. In my opinion, compared to the past, today's young people can do much more decisions that rely on their own. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.
To begin with, nowadays, university students can choose their major mainly dependent on their own, this is because today's internet is much more accessible compared to the past. my experience is a compelling example of this. About fifteen years ago, my father choose my university major by himself, he even not bother to ask me if I am interested in civil engineering. Seven years later, when I already worked a job related to civil engineering for four years, I finally had enough of this major, and I make a decision on my own that I want to change my major to computer science. Today, I am already a programmer, and I am very happy with my job every day.
Secondly, today's young people are freer than ever in marriage, in the past, people get married at their parents' will. In my country's past, young people are forced to get married in their twenties, and this kind of marriage is always unfortunate. For example, about thirty years ago, my friend also my colleague get married at his father's demand. He once told me, he was so regretful to marry his partner,  he felt tired and anxious every day caused by his partner. In addition, when they got married they only know each other for one week. By contrast, nowadays, I barely heard this kind of story ever happen in my country.
In conclusion, I strongly believe that compare to the past today's young people are freer to make decisions by their own will. This is because the internet helps today's young people to collect a lot of useful information, and people are freer on marriage issues nowadays.
