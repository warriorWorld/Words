The reading and the lecture are both about travel to Mars's feasibility. While the article mentioned three problems related to travel to Mars, the lecturer provides both of them with a solution. She thinks that travel to Mars is feasible.
To begin with, the author of the article mentioned that travel to Mars takes at least two years, and that makes bringing enough supplies of food, water, and oxygen a problem. However, the lecturer provides a solution for this, she says that we can plant plants in water without soil and this technique can spare a lot of space. The water used in this can be processed and later for people to drink,  furthermore, plants can make oxygen for human breath.
Secondly, the author of the reading says that a long-term zero-gravity environment will damage people's bodies in many ways. On the other hand, the lecturer says that we can solve this problem by exercising between missions and ingesting more Ca as a nutrient supplement. Additionally, she mentions that this implementation's validity is already proved by practice.
Finally, the author of the reading thinks that when humans travel to Mars, solar radiation is a problem. He mentions that building a shield that would protect the entire spaceship from space radiation is impossible. The lecturer disputes this by mentioning that extreme solar radiation only appears occasionally. And people can install a device that detects solar radiation, therefore, when dangers come, people can hide from it.
