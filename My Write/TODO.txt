It is critically important to know what is happening around the world in today's competitive society. Personally, I think knowing what is happening around the world is good for our life, even if it is unlikely will affect our daily life. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.
To begin with, global news can provide a lot of topics for people to discuss, and conversations benefit people's bound. My personal experience is a compelling example of this, my family usually watches global news while we have dinner. And we always discuss events happening around the world together, we talk about political, economic, and festivals. Sometimes we have disputes and sometimes we agree with each other. And I think This kind of discussion helps my family bond together and benefits our relationship. Without those topics the global news provided, we will not have so many topics to talk about.
Secondly, watching the news around the world can help you to learn a lot of things, news around the world often contains a lot of kinds of subjects, such as science, society, war, technology, etc. For example, about five years ago, I started to watch "China in focus" every day, which is a news program that focuses in China. From this program, I learned a lot of things, including political, economic, culture, and more importantly, I learned English from it, actually, my English listening skill is most learned from it. 
In conclusion, I strongly believe that people should care about what happening around the world even if it seems will not affect our daily life. This is because global news provides a lot of topics that families can discuss, and you can learn a lot kinds of things from global news, even your English skill can benefit from it.
