Personally, I'd prefer to save the extra money, rather than spend it right away.
First, when an accident or a disease suddenly appears. I can use that extra money to save my or my family's life. For example, in my country, there are a lot of people who have to give up their treatment because they don't have enough money.
Secondly, when you have extra money, you are freer at the workplace. For instance, I always refuse my work leader's requirement for me to work overtime. I don't afraid I could lose my job because I've saved a lot of money. By the way, in my country firing someone because he refused to work overtime is normal.
