Personally, I think it is obvious that having money and power is not the best definition of success. 
First, money and power are only means instead of purpose, I believe that is obvious. You know, no one wants money and power, what they really want are the other things, money and power are only means in order to achieve their purposes. And I think we should define success as someone has achieved his purposes. Money and power are not even purposes, so they cannot be a definition of success logically.
So, I think no need to further elaborate on this, because even logically, that is impossible.
