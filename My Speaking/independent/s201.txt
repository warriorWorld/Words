Personally, I prefer to watch the news instead of reading the news, I feel this way for several reasons.
First, when you are watching the news on television, you could do a lot of other things, such as taking a shit, eating your breakfast, or brushing your teeth. I could even close my eyes and just listen to the television news.
Second, news on television can provide more information than newspaper news, because news in newspapers is stationary and silent.
Third, news on television is more up-to-date compared to news in newspapers. Most newspapers only update once per day.
