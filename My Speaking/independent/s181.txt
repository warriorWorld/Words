Personally, I strongly agree with the statement that it is very important to learn about other cultures. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, learning a lot about other cultures can help you grow a lot of tolerance toward others. You know, in my country, because of the existence of the great fire wall which blocks Chinese people from entering the international internet, Nazism, totalitarianism, and authoritarianism are becoming more and more popular among young people in my country. Unfortunately, there are so many people in my country who support Russia who invaded Ukraine. And I think if they could access the international internet, they wouldn't be this way.
Second, you can actually learn a lot of things from other cultures, such as human history and societies. I, personally, have watched a lot of documentaries on Curiosity Stream, and learned a lot of things from them.
