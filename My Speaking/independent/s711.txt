Personally, I agree with the statement that the process of doing something is more important than the final result. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, personally, I love to play video games, such as Monster Hunter, Devil May Cry and Elden Ring. You know, if you also play video games you will know that the most interesting part of a game is when you don't have the final equipment and the final weapon but when you are struggling to get them. And when you finally manage to get all the equipment that you want, you will no longer want to play the game.
Second, I think human lives are the same as this, the most important part is the events that you've experienced instead of the end of your wealth or reputation.
