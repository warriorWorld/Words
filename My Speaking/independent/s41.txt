Personally, I would prefer to learn something from the internet, I feel this way for several reasons.
First, you know, it is very convenient learning things from the internet, you can actually learn things while you are using a toilet.
Second, it is extremely cheap studying things from the internet compared to learning things from a physical classroom. You know, in my country, people are very poor, a lot of them don't even have the money to afford a university education.
I, personally, purchased the Curiosity Stream service for 1 year, and on the website, I learnt a lot of things.
