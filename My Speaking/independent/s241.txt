Personally, I think it is obvious that students can gain more benefits from a small class. I feel this way for several reasons.
To begin with, students can gain more attention from their teacher in a small class, and also, a teacher can focus on students more in a small class. My personal experience is a compelling example of this, When I was a university student, I had a lot of classmates, and everytime in class, I cannot stay in focus because of all the students around me. As a result, I have to study by myself, only in this way can I study well. I think the most efficient way to study something is to study in a class that only has one student, in other words, just find a private tutor for yourself.
