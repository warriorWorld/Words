Personally, I agree with the statement that learning through online courses is more effective than learning in the traditional classroom setting.
I feel this way for several reasons.
First, It is very convenient to learn something on the internet. I mean, you can learn something while you are using the toilet or riding a bus.
Second, you can control your pace if you are learning something on the internet. You can learn whenever you want and not learn whenever you don't want to .
Third, usually, learning on the internet is much cheaper than learning in the traditional way. It is more affordable for young people. You know, you only need to pay less than one hundred dollars for a year's use of the Curiosity Stream.
