Personally, I think people should think carefully and take a lot of time to consider before they make decisions. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, sometimes, you must think deeply and then you can find the problems of your decisions. My personal experience is a compelling example of this, at first, my major was civil engineering, because I think I would love to build something. I selected the major without thinking further. And after four years    work as a building engineer, I feel regretted and I finally decided to change my major to computer science. Now I am already a programmer, and I love my new job.
