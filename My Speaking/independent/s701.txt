When I was a child, I really loved to play video games, such as Devil may cry, Elden Ring and Monster Hunter. I have learnt so many things from those games, mainly English, because you know, I'd love to play the English version of those games. 
And I was so shy at that time, and even now I don't like to play with others. Also, in my hometown, it is extremely cold during winter, you must stay in your home otherwise, the bitter cold may injure you or even kill you. 
When I was young, I also loved to watch animations such as One Piece and Berserk.
