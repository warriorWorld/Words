Personally, I don't agree with the idea that parents should help their children to choose a career.
First, I think when a child reaches the age that needs to select a career, he or she already has the capacity to take responsibility. So, I think children should choose careers on their own.
Besides, there are a lot of parents who have a very intensive urge to control their children, my father is an example of this, when I was a child, my father selected a career for me, he didn't even bother to ask me whether or not I like civil engineering. And after I graduated from university, I worked as a civil engineer for four years, then, I finally got enough of this career. I changed my profession from civil engineering to computer science.
