Personally, I agree with the idea that People today have healthier lifestyles than people did 100 years ago. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, industrialization occurred hundreds of years ago, and there was a lot of pollution in the past. Nowadays, people are more aware of environmental problems than in the past. In addition, in the past, people didn't even recognize that pollution was detrimental to human health.
Second, today's average life span is obviously longer than 100 years ago, this is because today's technology is extremely advanced than in the past in terms of medicine, and nowadays, people eat much more fruit than in the past.
