Personally, I'd prefer to collect information from the internet. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, It is very convenient to get information from the internet. You know, you can actually read some articles on the internet while you are using a toilet. 
Second, most articles or videos on the internet are free. If you are collecting data from printed materials you have to spend a lot of money on them.
Third, there is actually much more information available on the internet compared to printed materials. Actually, most printed materials such as books and magazines can be found on the internet.
