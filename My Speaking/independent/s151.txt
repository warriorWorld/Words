Personally, I agree with the statement that it is important to remember and learn from the past. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, we humans cannot make any progress if we don't learn things from the past. Even today, there are still a lot of totalitarian countries who prohibit their people from knowing their own true history. They are too afraid to let their people know the true history of their own. And in those countries, people are not allowed to have their own thoughts. Living in those countries is terrible. For some reason, I cannot tell you more details about this, I am so afraid to do so.
Second, science itself is based on experiments. In science, you have to first have a theory, and then, test it with some experiments, and then, adjust your theory according to the results of the experiments. And repeat those steps again and again. In other words, science itself is a method that learn from the past.
