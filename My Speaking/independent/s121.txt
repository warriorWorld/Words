Personally, I don't agree with the idea that it is essential for a person's education to learn to play a musical instrument. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, I, personally, cannot play any musical instruments, and I cannot even sing a single song, but I think I am fine. And I still love to listen to music. I love art, I don't think I have any issues that are caused by not knowing any musical instruments.
Second, learning a musical instrument is extremely expensive, most people, especially in developing countries, cannot afford this. You know, in my country, most people cannot even afford to learn English, even though English is so important without any doubt.
