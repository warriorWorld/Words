Personally, I don't agree with the statement that all workers should be required to stop working and retire by age 65. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, I think people should decide whether or not they will retire by age 65 on their own instead of by some regulations.
Second, some occupations actually require experience such as doctors, researchers, scientists, and engineers. They can work better when they are old than when they are young. I think it is a waste of human resources by making them retire mandatorily.
