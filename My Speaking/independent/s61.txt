Personally, I think people should do different kinds of work at different points in their lives. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, people must first experience, then can they know whether or not they like some kind of work. I think there is no other way around. Take me as an example of this, at first, my major was civil engineering, and after I worked as a building engineer, I finally decided to change my major.  Then after half a year's study, I became a programmer. I really love to code with Java, C Sharp, and Kotlin.
Second, people change, sometimes, we will become tired of our previous love. I think during that period, we should change our jobs in order to stay active.
