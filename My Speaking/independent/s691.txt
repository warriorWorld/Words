Personally, I'd prefer to take a lot of photographs at family gatherings and meetings with friends in order to remember those special occasions. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, you know, sometimes, people will die. For example, my grandfather has died several years, and sometimes I really miss him, fortunately, I have some pictures of him. Those pictures were taken when my family gathered ten years ago. And I always watch those pictures whenever I miss him. I am afraid if I don't have the pictures, I probably have already forgotten what he looks like.
