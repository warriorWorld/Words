Personally, I prefer to go to a film or a concert by myself rather than go with a group of friends. I feel this way for two reasons.
First, when you watch a movie or a concert all alone, you can focus on the movie or the music itself, rather than be concerned about your friends' opinions and ideas. For example, I once went to watch a film with my friend, and he always discusses the plot of the movie when we are watching it. it is really annoying. 
Second, people often have different interests themselves. this means when you and your friends decide where to go or what to do. Sometimes, you have to compromise with them. For instance, about Three years ago, my friends and I decided to go to travel together, and all my friends wanted to go to a mountain, but my favorite travel destination is the ocean. I have to compromise with them at that time.
