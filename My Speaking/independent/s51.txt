Personally, I agree with the statement that it is more important to study math and science compared to studying art and literature. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, math and science are the basis of our modern societies. Without them, we cannot provide ourselves with food, transportation systems, and those modern technologies such as mobile phones and cars.
And also, science and math can help us understand the universe that we live in.
That is why I believe that art and literature are secondary compared to science and math.
