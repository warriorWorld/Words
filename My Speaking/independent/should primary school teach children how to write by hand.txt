In my opinion, I agree with the idea that primary schools should no longer teach children how to write by hand, and instead, they should teach children how to type on a computer. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, nowadays, we barely need to write by hand due to technological developments. And I believe it is a waste of time to teach children a skill which is no longer in use.
Second, the world is always changing, we should accept this change. For instance, in the past, a lot of people learned how to ride a horse when they were young. But today, people no longer need to ride horses. I think we should accept reality, let the past be the past. And if someone wants to learn a thing which is no longer in use, he could study it by himself.
