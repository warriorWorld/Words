Personally, I'd prefer to go shopping only when I really need to shop. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, I think shopping is a waste of time, if I had that time, I'd rather play some games, such as Play Station games or Switch games.
And the second reason is my home is extremely far away from any shops, I have to spend at least one hour on the roads in order to go shopping. That's why everytime I go shopping I buy a lot of things. In this way, I can avoid shopping too frequently.
