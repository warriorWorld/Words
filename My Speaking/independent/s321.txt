Personally, I don't think children should be paid for doing chores.
To begin with, the money reward will turn internal incentives into external incentives. For example, there was an old man who always slept at noon, and one day a school opened near his house. And the children of that school often play at the school playground at noon since then. As a result, the old man cannot sleep anymore. And one day, the old man got an excellent idea, everyday, whenever the children are playing in the playground, the old man would give them one dollar. And a few weeks later, the old man told the children he had no money to give them anymore, but he still wanted them to play in the playground. In the end, the children never play in the playground anymore.
This is because if an action is driven by an external incentive, when the external incentive doesn't exist anymore, the action will also disappear along with the external incentive.
