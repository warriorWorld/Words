In my opinion, I think universities should spend their funding only for academic purposes. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, Universities, especially government owned universities, their funding mainly came from taxes. And I don't think taxpayers want their money spent on entertainment when there are still a lot of students who have to give up their education opportunities due to economic reasons.
Second, if a student wants some kind of entertainment, he  should spend his own money in order to do so. This is not just a question of who should pay for it. But also a question about choices. This is because if you spend your own money on something, you could choose freely, and if the money came from a university, you would have no choice or only a few choices.
