Personally, I agree with the idea that we should allow students to choose their seats, and allow them to sit in different seats on different days. I feel this way for two reasons.
First, when you can choose your seat freely, you could avoid a lot of annoying guys. For example, when I was in high school, my classmate who sit next to me was really annoying. He often talks to me when we are in class, and often makes a lot of noise when the teacher were speaking.
Second, I think it is very fair to do so, this is because if a student came to class first, he can select his seat first, and similarly if a student came to class last, he will have no choice at all. I think this will encourage students to come to class early rather than late.
