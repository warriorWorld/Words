Personally, I don't think people should schedule their free time in advance. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, when you spend your free time, I think you should have fun and do whatever you like to do. And if you schedule everything up, it will be very boring and not fun at all.
Second, usually, things will not go as scheduled, especially when you schedule your free time. For example, I usually spend my leisure time at home. When I am at home, my father sometimes may find me and let me help him repair something together, and sometimes my mother may find me and let me help her to cook. In most situations, things will not go according to schedule.
