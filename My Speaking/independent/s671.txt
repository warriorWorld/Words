Personally, I think if students choose to live in foreign countries they should live alone rather than living with a family member. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, if a student lives alone in a foreign country, he can learn a lot of things, such as how to manage his money, how to find a job on his own and how to make friends in a foreign country. You know, those overseas students who always hang out with their motherland people usually cannot learn well.
Second, I believe that most students don't have family members abroad. Myself is an example of this, you know, if I go to a foreign country, living alone is my only option.
