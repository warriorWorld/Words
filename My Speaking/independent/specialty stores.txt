Personally, I'd prefer to shop in small specialty stores or shops, I feel this way for several reasons.
First, at least, In my country, if you want to purchase some unusual goods, you have to buy them in a specialty store. This is because if you purchase unusual goods in a large store, you will most likely buy a fake one or an extremely low quality one. For example, l always buy longboards in a specialty store.
Second, a specialty shop's employees are typically more professional than a large store. For instance, grocery store's employees generally don't have enough knowledge about fishing rods to assist me select my fishing rod.
