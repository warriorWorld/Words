Personally, I don't agree with the requirement that all students should have their own laptops. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, not every student can afford a computer themselves, especially in countries that are very poor, such as my country. 
Second, if students use their own computers for classes. Some students' computers would have compatible problems with the software that teachers require. For example, some computers may be too old to suit the class, some laptops may have an operating system that cannot install the software that teachers require. This will create a lot of problems in the class.
