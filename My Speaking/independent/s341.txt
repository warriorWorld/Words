Personally, I agree with the idea that private cars should not be allowed in city centres. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, the air pollution is already so severe, and with no cars in city centres, the air pollution can be improved a lot. You know, a lot of people got clinic issues because of air pollution.
Second, nowadays, it is very convenient for people to travel by subway system, especially in big cities. And in my city, Beijing, you can travel by subway faster than private cars.
