Personally, I think people should enjoy taking risks and have some adventures. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, most people believe we humans only live once, although there are a lot of controversies here. But, anyway, I think we should enjoy our only chance to have some fun.
Second, only by taking some risks can we progress. Take me as an example of this, at first, my major was civil engineering, and after I entered the work-force for four years as a building engineer, I decided to change my major to computer science. Right now, I am already a programmer, I really love my new job. And if I didn't take that risk to change my major, I wouldn't be here right now. You know, in my country, changing your major is very risky, you have a considerable possibility to lose your job forever, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.
