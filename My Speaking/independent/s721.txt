Personally, I agree with the statement that friends should be able to tolerate different ideas and still remain their friendships. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, you can actually change your friends' ideas about something. About five years ago, my friend told me that he thinks HongKong should be managed by the mainland, and I disagreed with this idea. Then after days, I finally managed to convince him that HongKong should manage by themselves.
Second, I think even if you cannot convince your friends about something, it is still no big deal. Because everyone has their own thoughts, that is very normal.
