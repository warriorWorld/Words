Personally, I would prefer to work on class assignments on my own, I feel this way for several reasons.
First, you know, I am very intelligent, in other words, I don't have to rely on others in order to do just some class assignments.
And also, if I work with others, I have to handle relationships between me and others. I believe that it is a waste of my time.
Finally, I can learn a lot of things if I am working alone. Actually, I learnt English, and programming on my own, I believe it suits me very well.
