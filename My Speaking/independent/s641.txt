Personally, I'd prefer to get information from the internet. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, it is very convenient to get information from the internet. You know, you can browse news while you are using a toilet or riding a bus.
Second, books are usually very expensive, and also one book only contains limited content. On the other hand, you can get all kinds of information on the internet for almost free.
Third, you can get information from the Internet much more quickly than using books. With a search engine such as Google, we can access the information that we want within one second. Instead, if you want to get certain information from a library, you may spend all day long without getting the information that you want.
