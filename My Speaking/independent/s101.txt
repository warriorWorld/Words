Personally, I don't agree with the statement that all children should be required to learn a second language in school. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, most languages are not that important for most people except English. So, I think those whose mother tone is English don't need to learn a second language at all. It will only waste time for those people.
Second, learning a second language is very difficult and takes an extremely long time. Especially if your mother tone's grammar is so different from your second language's, such as Chinese and English. Take me as an example, I've leraning English for more than a decade. If I used that time to do other things, I would already become an expert on that thing, you know, I always want to be a game developer. But I don't have enough time to pursue that dream because of English.
