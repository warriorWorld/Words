Personally, I'd prefer to write a long report rather than give a speech in front of a large group of people if I was given a work assignment. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, a long report by text can contain much more information than a speech. You know, I am a programmer, my work has a lot of details related to computer technology. It is hard to fully express the details by merely giving a speech.
Second, a report by text can be reviewed repeatedly at anytime. If you want to know more about the report, you can just read it again. On the other hand, a speech cannot be reviewed, unless you have recorded it. But most people won't record a speech.
