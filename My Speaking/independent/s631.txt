Personally, I don't agree with the statement that teachers should not be too friendly to their students. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, I think only when students and teachers have good relationships can students learn well. You know, when I was still a child, my English teacher always had a hatred toward me, at that time, I didn't know why. But as a result, I didn't like English at all, I often ignore him during his classes. And ten years later, I have to study English again in order to take the TOEFL exam.
