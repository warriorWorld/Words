Personally, I agree with the statement that the best way to learn is by making mistakes. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, if you want to learn something, you must practise it. You know, I am a programmer, and they say that the best programmer is the one who encountered the most issues in his career. In computer science, you must learn from mistakes, otherwise, you cannot become a proper programmer.
Second, I think English learning is a good example of this, we must learn English by using it, such as speaking it, writing something in it. When I first speak in English, I always make a lot of grammar mistakes, but overtime, gradually by gradually, I made less and less mistakes on grammar.
