Personally, I'd prefer to live alone in a small apartment rather than living together with others. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, I am the kind of person who loves to be quiet. I don't want to live in a noisy environment. If you live with others, that is almost certainly unavoidable.
Second, personally I'd love to live in a clean room. You know, a lot of people don't have the habit of keeping their rooms clean. So I think I'd better live alone.
Third, I am not the kind of person who loves to communicate with others, if I have leisure time, I would like to read some books or play some games alone rather than deal with relationship problems.
