Personally, I think students should attend school full-time, I feel this way for several reasons.
First, I think we humans could only engage in one thing at the same time, if you do things simultaneously, most likely, you could not do them well. I think I don't have to give you an example of this, because almost everyone has this kind of experience.
Second, if you attend school while you are still working at a certain company, you would have no free-time at all. And this will bring you a lot of pressure, eventually, you will have mental health issues caused by this.
