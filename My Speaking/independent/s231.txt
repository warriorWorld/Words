Personally, I'd prefer to spend my free time reading some books, watching some documentaries, and playing some games alone. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, I consider handling relationships with others is extremely tedious for me. You know, since I was a child, I have already hated making friends. I am the kind of person who wants to be alone.
Second, when I am alone, I can study a lot of things by watching documentaries. I have watched so many documentaries, and most people don't like them, so it makes no sense to invite others watching those documentaries with me.
Besides all those things, I also like to play some games alone, such as Monster Hunter Rise, Monster Hunter World, and The Elden Ring.
