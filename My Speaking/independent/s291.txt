Personally, I'd prefer to study while no others around me. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, I can stay in focus only when there are no others around me. I mean even in a silent environment such as a library I cannot stay in focus. Because even in a library, there would always be some people walking around.
And the second reason is when I am studying I have to speak out loud especially when I am studying TOEFL. I have to practise my speaking by speaking out loud, and all the libraries will not allow me doing this.
And the final reason is if I am studying alone, I can lie down in my bed or I can study while I am using my toilet.
