Personally, I think It is obvious that family members are the most important influence on young adults. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, usually, family members have a much longer time living with their young adults, and as a result, they have more chance of affecting their young adults.
Second, most family members know their young adults from the beginning, I mean from their birth.  You know, human characteristics are mainly formed in their childhood. And because of this, most people's mental health issues are related to their childhood experiences. So, family members have more influence on young adults, actually have a statistical basis. Even though it is not a good influence, it is still an influence.
