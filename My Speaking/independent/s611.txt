Personally, I'd prefer to live in a place that is really close to my workplace or my university. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, it is very convenient to live in a place that is extremely close to your workplace. You could wakeup at a very late time and without the need to worry about the commute time. You know, I always live in my parents home, and the location is very far away from my workplace, it takes me two hours in order to arrive the workplace. As a result, I have to wakeup at 6:00 every day, and it almost kills me, I think everyone who has experienced this would know what I mean.
