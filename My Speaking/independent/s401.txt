In my opinion, I think that in the future, books and newspapers will be replaced by devices, such as smartphones, computers, and Kindle. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, smartphones and computers are much more convenient than books that means you can read books by smartphones everywhere, and anytime, even in darkness, you can read a book with a smartphone.
Second, smartphones are much more portable than books. Nowadays, a smartphone literally can store millions of books in it. Just imagine carrying millions of books on your way. That is simply impossible. But with smartphones, you can put those millions of books in your pocket.
Finally, books and newspapers are made of paper, and paper is made of trees. With today's climate changing problems, I don't think using books or newspapers is a good idea.
