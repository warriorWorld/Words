Personally, I don't think a university's academic reputation is the most important thing a student should consider when he is selecting a school. I feel this way for several reasons.
I think the first and also the most important thing a student should decide when he is selecting universities is which major he wants to study and work on. A student must first determine his major and then remove all the schools from the list that don't have the major he wants. Then, the second thing he should consider is the location of the school, because if a school is too far away from your home, you will not be able to go home regularly. And I believe the academic reputation is the third one a student should consider.
