You know, when I heard this question, I laugh out loud immediately. Are 18 years old people mature enough to vote? In my country, even if you are 80 years old, you have no right to vote. People are deprived of political rights for life when they are born in my country. You people from democracy countries are so naive and so cute. I don't even know if I am supposed to laugh or cry.
I definitely think that 18 years old is mature enough to vote. I want to vote on everything, including how to handle COVID-19, restrict work overtime, and let news media free to say everything. I want all of them. If I were lucky enough to be born in a democracy country, I will have that right. Unfortunately, I am not, I have no right to make a single vote, and that's why today I am in a TOEFL exam. If I have no right here, I will have the very right there, I must escape from here forever!
