Personally, I don't agree with the idea that your friends are the most important influence in your life. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, most people are very common on average, their abilities are limited, especially in my country. Most people in my country don't have their own thoughts, they would follow whatever the government demands them to do, and believe whatever the media says. Even though there is no media in my country, there are only propaganda entities. And that is why, today, I am here, for a TOFEL exam. I am here because I don't want to live in a country like this anymore.
