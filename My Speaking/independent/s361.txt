Personally, I'd prefer to buy food that is already prepared, I prefer this way for several reasons.
First, it is very convenient to just buy some prepared food to eat. You know, it is very annoying to cook by yourself, you have to buy all the ingredients yourself and wash them, and then cook them, and in the end, you have to wash all the utensils that were used.
Second, I am not a chef myself, I could only cook a few kinds of food. But if I just purchase some take-outs, I can choose from all kinds of food without limitation, and usually, take-outs are more delicious than my cooking.
