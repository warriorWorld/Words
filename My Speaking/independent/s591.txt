Personally, I'd prefer to select the subject that I really love regardless of job opportunities. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, I think only when you study the major that you really have interest in can you reach a high-level of that major. My personal experience is a compelling example of this, at first, my major was civil engineering, and I really don't like the subject. After four years of work as a building engineer, I finally changed my major to computer science. Right now, I have already reached a high-level expertise in programming. This is because I really love coding.
