Personally, I don't agree with the statement that students shouldn't be allowed to bring cell phones into the classroom. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, if some urgent things happened and you have a cellphone, it will be convenient. And you can call 911 or call your family. But if you don't have one around you, it is dangeous.
Second, we actually can learn a lot of things by smartphones. My personal experience is a compelling example of this. I aways use my smart phone to study English when I am commuting.
Third, most smart phones nowadays have GPS in them. So if something happened, such as a earthquake and you are burried in the classroom. The firefighter can locate you by your smartphone. That is life-saving benefit.
