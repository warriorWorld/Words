Personally, I agree with the idea that schools should teach some practical skills, such as cooking in addition to academic subjects. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, academic subjects are very abstract, as a result, they are hard to understand, especially to students of their age. Sometimes, you must learn something through practice. My personal experience is a compelling example of this. My major is computer science, with my major, you must learn it by practising, otherwise, you cannot learn it well. You must develop a lot of applications on your own, only in this way can you learn computer languages.
