Personally, if I received a large amount of money unexpectedly, I would spend it on pleasant things. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, we humans only have a few decades to live, life is short, we should spend it on pleasant things. And some people say that pleasure is short and temporary. But I think life itself is also temporary and short.
Second, I believe that life's final purpose is pleasure, and all the other things, such as they called practical things are the tools that we would use in order to reach the pleasure end. In other words, pleasure is the purpose, and the so called practical things are the methods, not the other ways around.
