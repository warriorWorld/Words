Personally, I agree with the idea that it is very important that a person has a college education in order to have a successful career. I feel this way for several reasons.
You know, in my country, you have to have a college education experience in order to find a good job. My classmate from primary school doesn't have a college education. As a result, he can only work as an assemble line worker or a waiter in a restaurant. He always complains about his work with me. And since I have a college education, I can work as a programmer.
I don't know what about other contries' situation, but at least, in my country, it is true that a person must has a college education, if he want a fine job.
