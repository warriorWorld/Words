Personally, I'd like to spend my free time with the same small group of close friends. I feel this way for two reasons.
First, when you just have a few amounts of friends, you often have a lot of free time just for yourself. And I always enjoyed that precious free time for studying TOEFL and playing PlayStation Games, such as Monster Hunter, Devil May Cry, and Elden Ring.
Secondly, close friends usually know you very well, and when you need help, they often could provide proper solutions. For example, about 5 years ago, my company laid off a lot of employees caused of its financial problem. And I'm one of them. Three months later, my friend called me, he recommend me a company. When I went to that company, I'm surprised. Because that company absolutely has no work overtime. You know, in my country, this is extremely rare. My friend knows I never work overtime, that is why he recommends me this company.
