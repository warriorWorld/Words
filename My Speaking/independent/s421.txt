Personally, I would prefer living in a big city, I feel this way for two reasons.
First, a big city typically has a lot of work opportunities waiting for you. And the commuting time in a big city is considerably shorter than rural areas. That makes you have a lot of free time.
Second, the hospital numbers in a big city are commonly much higher than rural areas. And since the transportation systems in a big city are much more advanced than rural areas, when you get sick, you could go to a hospital quickly. And sometimes, it makes the difference between life and death.
