Personally, I don't agree with the idea that parents should involve in the choice of a university for their children. I feel this way for several reasons.
Fisrt, I think when children reach the age that need to select a university, I think they already have the ability to take responsibility on their own. I believe children should do things on their own as long as they are capable of, in this way, they can grow stronger and stronger.
The second reason is if parents have selected a university for their children, in the future, the children may blame their parents for doing so. I am an example of this, actually, I often blame my father for having selected my university without asking me if I am willing to go to that school.
