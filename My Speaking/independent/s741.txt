Personally, I don't agree with the statement that teenagers have caused many problems for their parents. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, we humans all have to experience the period of teenager unless we die before it. And I think if teenagers really are that problematic, then our societies cannot exist. In other words, I think that teenagers loving to cause the so called problems actually is a very normal phenomenon. And I believe parents should guide their children becoming good people when they think they need to.
