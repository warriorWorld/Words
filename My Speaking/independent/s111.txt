Personally, I think we should allow children  to watch whatever television programmes they choose to. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, even though most people don't think so, I think children have their own judgement, they know what is good and what is not. If parents selected a television program for their children, those children probably wouldn't be satisfied. And if they want to watch a certain television programme, since almost every child has their own mobile phones. They can watch it on their mobile phones without their parents knowing it.
Second, most parents cannot be considered good in terms of judgement. As a result, I don't think letting them decide which TV program their children should watch will make things better. I think we should have confidence in our children, and believe in them. If in the end things turn bad, we should just accept.
