Personally, I agree with the idea that if a teacher is kind and friendly his students will learn well. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, when a teacher is kind and friendly, his students will be more willing to ask him questions. It is obvious that the more questions students have asked the more knowledge they will learn. By contrast, if a teacher is strict, students are most likely afraid to ask him questions.
Second, at students' age, they are very sensitive to emotions. This is because children have to rely on others to survive. As a result, almost all children are sensitive to emotions. And if a teacher is strict or tough, children would not want to be close to him.
