Personally, I'd like to use cell phones in order to talk with my friends rather than using text messages. I feel this way for several reasons. 
First, sometimes, just using text messages cannot express your intentions, and you have to use your voice in order to say things clearly. You know, people have to know your emotions when you are saying something, otherwise, they may mistake your intentions. And usually, people can understand your emotions by your voice but not by your text messages. And that is why emoji was invented. But sometimes, even emoji can make some misunderstandings.
