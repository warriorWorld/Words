Personlly, I agree with the idea that today's people can access healthy food easier compared to 50 years ago.
First, it is extremely convenient to order some food on the internet, and you can select all kinds of food on the internet, all healthy or unhealthy food. In the past, that was impossible.
Second, people are more aware of the importance of healthy food. In the past, people did not care about the health of food, because they were very poor at that time, and they had a lot of other things to care about. In other words, they didn't have the extra energy to care about the health of food. You know, in the past 50 years, people's average life span has increased dramatically.
