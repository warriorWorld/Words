Personally, I don't agree with the idea that in order to protect children we should prohibit candy and junk food advertisements shown on television. I feel this way for several reasons.
To begin with,  it is parents who should take responsibility for their children, not candy companies or junk food producers or the whole society. If we let societies take all the responsibilities to everyone and everything, that kind of society cannot be good. and that kind of thought is Nazism, it is communism. We all know how bad those thoughts could be, I think I need no more to explain.
Second, I think just eating some candies or some junk food is fine and delicious, it will not hurt our bodies, and I think only if you eat too many of them will you get hurt.
