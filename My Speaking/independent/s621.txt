Personally, I definitely agree with the idea that with modern technology, people can live simpler compared to the past. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, you know, in the past, we had to find a tutor in order to learn something, and find another tutor if we wanted to learn other things. But nowadays, we can simply learn anything on the internet. I've purchased a year for the Curiosity Stream service, and I have learned so many things from the website.
Second, nowadays, we can travel anywhere within just one day, in the past, that is simply impossible.
