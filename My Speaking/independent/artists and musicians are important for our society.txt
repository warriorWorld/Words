Personally, I agree with the idea that artists and musicians are important for our society. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, I think entertainment is the final purpose of human beings. We humans all want happiness, and entertainment is one kind of happiness. artists and musicians bring us entertainment which can contribute to our happiness.
Second, music and art could bring us inspiration. Sometimes, even a scientist could be inspired by the arts, let alone architects. We don't even need an example of which building is inspired by art. Because architecture itself is art, and architects themselves are artists.
