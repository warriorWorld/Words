Personally, I don't agree with the idea that in the future, people will read fewer books than they do today, I feel this way for several reasons.
First, there are still a lot of illiteracies around the world, but the illiteracy rate is in constant decrease. Thus, in the future, there definitely will be less and less illiteracy around the globe.
Second, nowadays, there are roughly eight billion people all around the world. But the global population is on a steady increase. This will make the future's global population much bigger than today's, and, obviously, people will read more books than today in terms of volume. Because, more people mean more reading.
