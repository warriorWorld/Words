Personally, I'd prefer buying things on the internet. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, it is very convenient for buying things on the internet, you can actually buy things while you are using a toilet or lying in a bed.
Second, on the internet, you can actually choose something from thousands of stores. In this way, not only can you select the cheapest of them all, but also the most quality one.
Third, there are a lot of things that are difficult to find in physical stores, such as something that only a few people are in need. For example, the longboard, in China, there are only a few people playing the longboard in the year 2008. So I can only buy them on the internet.
