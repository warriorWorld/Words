Personally, I think it is obvious that fiction is more enjoyable compared to nonfiction to students or anyothers. I feel this way for several reasons.
Frist, nonfiction is usually too serious for students. Most students are very young, I think most people agree that young people don't like serious things.
On the other hand, fiction often has a lot of wonderful things in it, and it typically contains a lot of imaginations that are charming for children. For example, Harry Potter contains a lot of interesting things that a science book cannot compare to.
