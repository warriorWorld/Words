Personally, I agree with the statement that children should learn to draw. I feel this way for several reasons.
First, if children can draw, they can enjoy the art itself and also by showing the drawing to others, they can cultivate confidence within themselves.
Second, I have always wanted to be a game developer since I was a child. But I cannot draw myself, as a result, I have to rely on others to provide me with the art resources of games. It costs me a lot of money when I develop games.
Thrid, I think children should enjoy themselves when they are still in their childhood, and drawing is fun, so just enjoy it.
