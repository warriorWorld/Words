The lecturer explains the two advantages of subsurface locomotion by giving two examples.
The first advantage of subsurface locomotion is it can help animals to avoid high temperatures. For instance, there is a kind of lizard who lives in deserts, and it can move through sand very quickly. In this way, the lizard can minimize the detrimental caused by the climate.
The second benefit of this is it could assist animals to catch prey. Still the lizard, those lizards could sense vibration on the surface of the sand caused by their prey. And then they could move close to their prey rapidly under the sand, and catch their prey by surprise.
