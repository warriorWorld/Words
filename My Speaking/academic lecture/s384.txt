The lecturer explains how economic development changed    ancient world by providing two examples.
First, people began to pay with currency instead of paying with goods. By this way, if a baker wants a coat, he can just purchase it with his money instead of his bread.
Second, people began to buy things from far away, before that, they could only get things locally. For instance, people began to purchase fabric such as silk from Chinese people. In addition, since they can only buy silk from far away, the silk prices were usually very high.
