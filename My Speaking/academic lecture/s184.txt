The lecturer explains two ways that target customer characteristics can influence marketing strategies.
The first is the age of their target customers. For example, toy companies must advertise their products at the time that children can watch their TV shows.
The second characteristic is the location of their customers. For instance, boat producers must advertise their products near oceans or lakes in order to reach their target customers. 
That are the two ways target customer characteristics can affect marketing strategies.
