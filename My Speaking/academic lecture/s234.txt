The lecturer explains two ways that carnivorous plants utilized to catch their prey.
The first way is an active way. For instance, the Venus Fly Trap can use their leaves to catch their prey, their leaves can open and close just like a mouth. And if insects land on their leaves, they will close their leaves and digest the insect.
The second way is a passive way. For example, sundew plants also use their leaves to catch their prey. Their leaves have a lot of hair covered with a lot of sticky material. When insects land on their leaves, insects wouldn't be able to escape from the glue-like material, and will be degested by the material.
