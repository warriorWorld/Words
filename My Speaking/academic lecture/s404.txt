The lecturer provided two methods on how to effectively address customers' concerns by giving two examples.
The first method is to provide special features of the product to customers. For instance, in an electronic store, a customer thinks that the laptop is too expensive. The salesman could point out how fast the computer is, which outweighed the expensiveness. 
The second one is to directly demonstrate the goods' features to customers. For example, the client wants to know how portable the laptop is. The salesman could directly unplug the computer and put the laptop in a carry case in order to show the portability of the computer.
