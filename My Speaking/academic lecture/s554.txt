The lecturer explains babies attachment toward their caretakers by giving an example.
In the past, scientists believed that babies prefer to attach their caretakers because they would provide them with food. But now, this belief has changed. An experiment puts some baby monkeys in a place that has two mothers and both of them are made of wires. And one of them wears some very soft clothes, while the other keeps naked. The naked one would feed those baby monkeys. Although the naked mother would feed those babies, those baby monkeys would attach to the cloths mother whenever it is not feed time.
This experiment proved that babies don't attach to their caretakers because they feed them.
