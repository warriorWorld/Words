The lecturer explains two strategies that customers used to help them select products that they want.
The first strategy is by researching thoroughly. For instance, if someone wants to buy a computer, he would research the computer performance deeply, and then buy one of them.
The second strategy is staying loyal to the same brand. For example, if someone has a car, and the car performed very well in the past, the man had a positive experience with the car. And in the future, when the man wants to buy a new car, he will most likely still buy a car of that brand.
