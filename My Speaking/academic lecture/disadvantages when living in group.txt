The lecturer explains the disadvantages when animals living in a group by providing two examples.
First, she mentioned when animals live in a group they usually are more visible to their predators, such as sardines. And a whale usually can not find a single sardine but if they are in a group they are very easy to find. 
Second, she said a group of animals also have a lot of young animals, and parents often can not find their own children in a large group. For example, bats usually live in a cave, and they usually crowed together, when bat parents went out to find food and returned, they sometimes feed other's children by mistake.
