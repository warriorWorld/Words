The lecturer explains two changes after machines are used to produce goods.
The first change is that the centre of production has moved from homes to factories. For instance, machines could weave clothes more quickly and efficiently compared to individuals.
The second change is cities begin to establish around factories. People who work at factories need homes to reside, and they live around the factories and formed cities.
