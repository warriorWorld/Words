The lecturer explains how artists express their emotions through their works. Typically, they use colours, textures, lines and shapes in order to express their moods.
For example, red is a strong color that can express strong emotions such as excitement, joy and even anger, and blue is considered cool.
Textures can also express emotions, such as toughness, softness, and smoothness. Even though paintings cannot express their textures by touch, they can express them by visual.
Artists also combine those elements in order to express complicated emotions.
