The lecturer explains two kinds of protective resemblance strategies by giving two examples.
The first is the static protective resemblance strategy. For example, horn frogs have bodies that resemble leaves in both colors and shapes. And since they don't visit other places, they will be fine in the same colours and shapes.
The second is the adaptive protective resemblance strategy. For instance, there is a kind of lizard who can change their colors according to the environment. Because they need to travel to different environments, they developed a way to change their colors. If they are walking on a lot of dead leaves, they will change to brown, and if they are running on a lot of living grass, they will change to green.
