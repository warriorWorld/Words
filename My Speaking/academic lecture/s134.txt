The lecturer explains two kinds of camouflages that help sea animals to avoid predators. 
The first kind of camouflage is through permanent colors. For instance, leafy sea dragons look like a leaf with a green color. They can blend into green plants in order to avoid predators.
The second kind of camouflage is by changing colors. For example, cuttlefish can change their color according to the surrounding environment in seconds. If they are around green plants they can change to green, if they are around the sea bottom they can change to brown. In this way, they can blend into any environment in order to hide from their predators.
