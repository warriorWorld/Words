The lecturer explains why recently, researchers consider babies having their own empathy toward others by giving an example.
She mentioned some researchers make some babies hear a baby cry sound in a tape, and then those babies also cried. And they think the babies cried because of the noise the tape was making. The researchers then let the babies hear their own cry sound, but this time, the babies didn't cry, the researchers were surprised, because this means those babies didn't cry because of the noise, but maybe because they had empathy toward others.
