The lecturer explains why some plants would avoid sunlight even though they need sunlight to survive by giving two examples.
The first reason is that some plants prefer to cling to trees or other tall buildings, such as vines. Vines would remain in the dark shadow of trees in order to climb to the top of the trees. Eventually, they will reach the top of the trees and reach  sunlight.
The second reason is that some plants need to conserve their moisture. If they are exposed to sunlight, they will lose water and dry out. For example, there is a kind of bean plant which can put their leaves sideaway when sunlight is too strong for them.
