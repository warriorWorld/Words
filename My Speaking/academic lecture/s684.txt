The lecturer explains two ways that humans explain their inappropriate behaviors.
The first one is by using excuses, they would say the circumstances are beyond their control. For instance, if some students were late for classes, they would say their alarms were broken.
The second one is by using justification. For example, some students would say because they had a very important job interview, and they had to go to the interview first and that is why they were late.
That are the two ways that people used to explain their bad behaviors.
