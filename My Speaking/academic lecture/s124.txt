The lecturer explains substitute goods and complement goods by giving two examples.
Substitude goods are the kind of goods that one product can replace the other goods without any difficulties. Such as butter and margarines, when butter prices go up, the demand for margarines will increase. Because people could use margarines instead of butter in order to cook something.
Complement goods are the kind of goods that one product has to rely on the other goods in order to work. Such as CD players and CDs, you have to use them simultaneously, otherwise, they will not work. As a result, if the demand for CD players drops, the demand for the CDs will also decrease.
