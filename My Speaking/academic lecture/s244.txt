The lecturer explains two types of narrator that literature can use.
The first type of narrator is the objective narrator. Objective narrator can only describe things objectively, such as a man and a woman taking a trip together. Objective narrator can describe what they are doing, and what they are saying.
The second type of narrator is the omniscient narrator. The omniscient narrator can describe everything, literally everything. Not only what the man and the woman are doing or saying, but also what they are thinking, such as the man being really nervous when he took the trip with the woman in order to meet his old friend.
