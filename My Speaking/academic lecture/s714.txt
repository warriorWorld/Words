The lecturer explains two characteristics of the teacher's feedback. 
First, she believes that teachers should give their feedback while students are studying. For instance, in a painting class, the teacher should give his feedback while the student is working on his painting, in this way, the student can correct his work in time.
Second, she thinks that teachers should put their feedback focusing on the work rather than students, because if teachers criticize students, students will feel bad. But if they focus the feedback on the works, for example, in a painting class, the teacher thinks that the color of the painting is not good, the student can change his color next time.
