The lecturer explains two defense mechanisms that humans used. 
The first mechanism is fantasy. For instance, a woman lost her pet dog, she might fantasy a happy story about her dog, such as a nice family found her dog and raised her dog. And her dog was really happy and ran around with fun.
The second mechanism is sublimation. sublimation is not pretending, but practical. For instance, the woman maybe opens a dog training school in order to avoid any such accidents happening again. In this way she could redirect the pain to a positive one.
