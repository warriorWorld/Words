The lecturer explains two ways that product bundling helped stores to sell their products.
First, this strategy could encourage customers to buy more. For example, a computer store could bund a computer and a printer together and sell them at a reasonable price. Some customers would buy the bundling even if they only want a computer since the price is very good.
Second, it can help the store to sell their old products or those products that are not popular. For instance, the computer store could sell some old games with a computer together, in this way, they can make the games off the shelves and clear up storage.
