The lecturer explains how the camera's invention affected art in two ways.
First, artists began to use cameras as a tool in order to draw paintings realistically. By this way, they can catch a fleeting moment, for instance, they can catch a horse's photo of it running while its legs are in mid-air.
The second is about changing conceptually. Artists began to draw paintings abstractly in order to distinguish from photos. For example, they began to draw skin colors green, purple, and blue.
