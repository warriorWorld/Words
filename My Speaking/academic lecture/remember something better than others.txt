The lecturer explains why we can remember something better than others by giving two examples.
First, she said if we had knowledge about something, we could remember things that were related to that knowledge very well. For example, if you went to a classical music concert, you can recall that concert very well even the details for years when you have the classical music knowledge beforehand. By contrast, if you didn't have the knowledge, you would most likely not recall it well.
Second, the professor mentioned that we are good at remembering something unusual. For instance, you would most likely remember the unusual classmates between your classmates after years, such as a girl who is really intelligent, or a man who is extremely tall.
