The lecturer explains two ways that environmental conditions can affect ancient artifact preservation.
She mentioned that bacteria is the key point of artifact preservation, when there are no bacteria, artifacts can be well preserved.
The first is aridity, bacteria cannot live in dry places such as deserts. For instance, scientists have found some wallpaintings in Egypt that are so well-preserved, even now, we can still clearly see the colours.
The second is oxygen, most bacteria will not be able to survive in a place that has no oxygen. For example, the ocean bottom, scientists have found a lot of well-preserved ships at the bottom of oceans.
