The lecturer explains two technologies that allowed Roman cities to expand far bigger than other cities.
The first technology is a kind of advanced material--concrete. Concrete can become solid over time, and Romans use it to build bridges, in this way, they can build a city on both sides of a river. And the bridge is capable of transporting wagons.
The second technology is called aqueduct. Romans use aqueducts to bring water from far away, such as a mountain top. In this way, they can build a city even if the city's location doesn't have a river.
This are the two technologies that make Roman cities more advanced than others.
