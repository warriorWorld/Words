The lecturer explains two strategies that advertisements are used in order to persuade people buying products.
The first strategy is by repeating the same information again and again. In this way, the advertisement can keep its exposure to people. For example, a car advertisement always says that it has plentiful spaces for your friends and for your family members. Even though the car looks very small, people will tend to believe the advertisement.
The second strategy is by using someone famous such as a celebrity to advertise your products. For instance, if a racing car driver says that a car is good, people will tend to believe him even though  the car is really cheap and not very fast.
