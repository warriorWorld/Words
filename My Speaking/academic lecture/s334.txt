The lecturer explains the two advantages of franchising by giving two examples.
The first advantage is the training, when you open a store from franchising, they will train you in all aspects, and let you follow to success. For instance, if you open a pizza restaurant, the headquarters of the brand will send staff to your restaurant and train you and your employees in how to prepare your pizza and how to handle food orders.
The second advantage is the customer base. When you are franchising a store you will have loyal customers of that brand. Still the pizza example, when you open that pizza restaurant, a lot of the pizza brand's followers will come to your restaurant, since they have trust in that brand they will also believe in your pizza.
