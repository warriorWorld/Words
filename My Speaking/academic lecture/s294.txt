The lecturer said when a company's sales have stopped, it need diversify its products.
The first way to diversify a company's products is to use some already existing technology that they have, to develop some new products. For instance, a television producer could use their technology to produce computer monitors, in this way, the company can have some new customers.
The second way to diversify a firm's products is to produce some new products and sell them to the company's already existing loyal customers. For example, a ski producer could sell ski jackets to their customers because some of their customers may want to wear something that has the company's logo.
