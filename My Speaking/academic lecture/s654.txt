The lecturer explains two ways that predators like to use in order to catch animals who are in a group.
The first way is by identifying individuals from group members. For example, Mino fish lives in groups, and some Mino fish have different colours than others. As a result, predators love to catch the Mino fish that has different colours, in this way, they can easily identify the individual fish.
The second way is by physically breaking up the groups. For instance, sharks can use their tails to break up fish groups and make the group become smaller and smaller. In this way, they can easily identify individuals.
