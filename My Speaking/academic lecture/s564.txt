The lecturer explains how railroads changed United States business in two ways.
First, Railroads allowed businesses expanding to the entire country. Before railroads were invented, businessmen could only sell their products to local people such as in a city. And when railroads are available, businessmen can sell their products such as clocks across the entire country.
Second, Railroads make factories have the ability to open everywhere in America. Before railroads were available in the United States, they could only open at places that had raw materials around them, such as coal. And after the railroad was invented, factories can open anywhere, and purchase coal or other materials from anywhere in the country.
