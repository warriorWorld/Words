The lecture explains display behaviors. When animals live together in order to handle predator threats, they must maintain their relationship. There are two kinds of display behaviors. 
First, the threatening behavior, animals use threatening behavior to warn others. For example, two baboons want the same fruit. And one of them will stare at the other, and the other baboon will just give up on the fruit in order to avoid conflict.
The second is friendly behavior, for instance, two baboons who had fought with each other in the past, want to make up their relationship. They will make some friendly noise and even hug each other.
