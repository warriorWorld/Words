The lecturer explains two kinds of attention by giving two examples.
Active attention is hard to keep, such as in a biology class, the teacher is explaining frog just by speaking, and it will not take a long time for the students becoming bored.
Passive attention is the kind of attention that takes no effort. Still the biology class example, this time, the teacher brings a frog in the classroom and shows it to the students and lets the frog jump around the classroom. Because of this unexpected event, students will become engaged and pay attention to the class.
