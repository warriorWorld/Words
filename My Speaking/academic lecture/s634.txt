The lecturer explains two disadvantages that decentralization has.
The first disadvantage is that a branch company may damage the overall company's profit. For instance, a clothes branch company may not sell very well. And if you are the central company, you may close the store, but the branch company would not close itself.
The second disadvantage is that the policy of the central company may vary in different ways in the branch companies. For example, one customer may want to return clothes, and most of the branch companies may accept the return for him, but with one branch company doesn't want to refund him, the company's overall reputation may be damaged by this.
