The lecturer explains two adaptations that help animals to live underground.
The first adaptation helps animals move through the soil. For instance, moles have big claws which look like shovels. They can use their big claws cutting soil and loosening soil and then throwing the soil behind them. In this way, they can move underground.
The second adaptation helps animals protect themselves from soil particles. Still moles as an example, moles have a pair of tiny eyes that are covered by thin skin, and have hair on thin skin. The hair can protect mole eyes from soil particles entering their eyes.
