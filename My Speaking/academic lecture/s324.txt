The lecturer explains two ways paved roads can harm animals and plants.
The first way is paved roads could carry plant seeds with the cars on it, and spread them alone the way. For example, starthistles can spread their seeds by cars, and compete with other plants for water.
The second way is paved roads could act as barriers to animals. For instance, the kit foxes eat mice and squirrels, and they are afraid to cross streets because the streets are usually full of cars run on them. Thus, they will not have enough food for them due to their territories being dramatically reduced by paved roads.
