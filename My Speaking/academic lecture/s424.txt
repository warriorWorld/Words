The lecturer explains how climate change affects animals by giving an example.
Thunder birds are giant and cannot fly. Scientists found a lot of thirty five thousand years old thunder bird bones in just one place. They try to explain this phenomenon. They think due to climate change a big area has had a long time with no rain. And eventually, the place became the last place that had water. And the thunder birds flocked together to that area. And when the water dried up the thunder birds also died up. Unfortunately, when the drought was over, the thunder birds were already extinct.
