The lecturer explains how animals achieve speed by giving two examples.
First, some animals can run on rough ground without hurting themselves. For instance, cheetahs can run on hot sand without hurting their feet even if they run slowly, this is because they have some very thick pads on their feet.
Second, some animals could use their long legs in order to run very fast. For example cheetahs have very long and muscular legs, those legs help them run very fast, they can move a very long distance with just one leap.
