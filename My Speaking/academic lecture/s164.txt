The lecturer explains two kinds of locus controls.
The first is internal locus control. For instance, if a woman is an internal locus control person, and she is preparing for an interview, she will prepare it with hardwork. And if the interview goes well, she will think it is because of her hardwork, and if the interview doesn't go well, she will blame herself.
The second is external locus control. For example, if a man is also preparing for an interview, and he is an external locus control person.  He will not prepare for the interview seriously. And if he failed the interview, he would blame the interviewer instead of himself. And also, if he succeeded in the interview, he will also think it is because the interviewer had a good mood at that time.
