The lecturer explains two advantages that controlled forest fires have. In the recent 20 years, scientists realized that controlled forest fires are good for forests.
First, some tree species rely on fires to reproduce. Such as pine trees, they spread their seeds and use the heat of fires to open up and release their seeds from their protective organs.
Second, controlled fires can kill some trees and without killing other trees, this will make a lot of open areas available for new shrubs to grow and new shrubs allow new animals to live in the area.
