The lecturer explains two hoarding strategies that animals used.
The first is by storing food in one location, those animals who can defend themselves usually would use this strategy, such as a kind of squirrel who would store their food under trees, they have the ability to prevent other animals from stealing their food.
The second strategy is by dispersing their food in different places. In this way, even if some animals find some of their food, they cannot take all of it. And those animals who would use this strategy usually have good memories. Such as rats and rats like to bury their food under sand in a lot of locations, and they have good memories as well.
