The lecturer explains two ways a lake can disappear.
The first one could be caused by organic sediments. When plants die, they will form a layer of muddy material at the bottom of a lake. And gradually by gradually, the muddy material will occupy all the room the lake has, and water will be nowhere to store. Then the lake will disappear.
The second one could be caused by human activities, for example, farmers need water to irrigate their fields. Sometimes, they would pump out water from a lake, and if the lake doesn't have any water refill or there is no rain in the area, the lake will also disappear.
