The lecturer explains  two principles about interior design.
The first principle is unity. Unity means you should use styles consistently, such as using similar colors. For instance, you can use green on the walls and on some sheets, sofas and rags. But too much unity will make people feel bored.
So, we need contrast to disrupt the consistency. We can intentionally change colors in order to use contrast as a principle. For example, we can use some red on a dark coloured sofa. It will standout from its environment. But too much contrast is also dangerous. It will make you feel busy and chaotic.
