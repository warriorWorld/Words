The lecturer explains two ways that plants used to defend themselves from insects.
The first way is by preventing insects from landing on them. For instance, passion plants have a lot of little spike-like hairs, those hairs leave no room for insects landing on the plant. In this way, the insects cannot eat the passion plants.
The second way is through chemicals. For example, potatoes can release a kind of chemical which can make the one who eats it feel full. When insects eat potato leaves, the potato will secrete the chemical, and after the insects eat the chemical, they will stop eating the leaves, because they already feel full.
