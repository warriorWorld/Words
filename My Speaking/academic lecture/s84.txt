The lecturer explains two marketing strategies related to the initial prices of products.
The first strategy is to set your product price high, and later lower the price. In this way, you can give your customers a high-quality image of your products. And also you can earn a lot of money by the first stage of your strategy, and appeal to more customers in the second stage of your strategy.
