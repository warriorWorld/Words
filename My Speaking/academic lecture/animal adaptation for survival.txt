The lecturer explains animal adaptation techniques for survival by giving two examples.
First, she describes defensive adaptation, For example, a turtle has a very hard shell around its body, and it also has a very flexible neck, which can hide in its shell. 
Second, she mentions another kind of adaptation, which is called offensive adaptation. For instance, a porcupine has very sharp quills around its small body, and when a predator sees those threatening sharp quills, it will just retreat for its safety.
These two examples demonstrate how physical adaptations work.
