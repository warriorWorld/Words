The lecturer explains how environmentally friendly businesses can benefit business in two ways. 
First, in this way, business can actually save a lot of money. For instance, a coffee shop uses a new kind of light bulb that is environmentally friendly. As a result, they not only saved a lot of energy, but also saved a lot of money because of the reduced energy cost.
Second, by engaging in environmentally friendly businesses, business can  be more attractive to certain customers. For example, the coffee shop uses paper cups, this kind of paper can be recycled and because of this they don't need to cut down new trees. The coffee shop puts this in their advertisements in order to attract certain customers.
