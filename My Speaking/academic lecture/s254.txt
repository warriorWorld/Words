The lecturer explains two ways can cause rock weathering.
The first way can cause weathering is by temperature and water. When water fills rock cracks, at night, the water freezes. You know, ice density is less than water's, so its volume will expand. In this way, the cracks will get bigger, and gradually by gradually, the rock will break down.
The second way weathering can occur is by plants. Plants can grow in rock cracks, for instance, a tree can grow in a rock crack, and its root can grow very deep in the crack in order to reach water and nutrition, eventually, the rock will be broken by the tree.
