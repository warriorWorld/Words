The lecturer explains two kinds of eyes that assist birds to survive.
The first kind of eyes are located in front of a bird's face just like a human. In this way, the bird can see clearly, and can determine the distance of an object. Such as eagles who can see from a very long distance, this ability helps them to catch mice.
The second kind of eyes are located on each side of a bird's head. This can help birds to avoid predators. For example, ducks use their eyes to watch both sides of their heads, in this way they can avoid foxes more efficiently.
