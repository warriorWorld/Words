The lecturer explains two factors that will affect customers selection when customers are facing some products which have the same price.
The first factor is reliablity. Reliablity means something works for a long time and without the need for repairment, such as a car who works well with absence of defection. But today's standard of manufacture is so high, this makes nowadays, most people don't care the reliablity anymore, They are more caring about the feature of the products. 
And the feature of a product is the most deciding factor when a customer is selecting some products. Feature means make your product cool, such as the air conditioner in a car or a electrical window in a car.
