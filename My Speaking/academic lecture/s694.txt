The lecturer explains two ways that mammals used to move between trees. In order to avoid predators, mammals prefer to move between trees without touching the ground.
The first way to do this is by using a wing-like organ. Lemurs are a kind of small mammal who have wing-like organs which can help them to glide from one tree to another.
The other way to move between trees is by using physical force, such as orangutans. Orangutans are a kind of large ape. They can swing and bent the tree over and use it to help them go to another tree.
