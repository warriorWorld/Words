The lecturer explains how some animals cultivate their own food sources by giving two examples.
First, she mentioned there is a kind of fish that eats seaweed. The fish would swim around the seaweed in order to protect it from other fish. In addition, the fish would even help the seaweed to remove other plants that blocked the sunlight from the seaweed.
Second, the professor said there is a kind of ant that raises aphids in order to eat their secreta. The ants would guard the aphids from other animals. The ants also would feed aphids and even raise their young.
