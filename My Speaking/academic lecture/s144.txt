The lecturer explains two kinds of adaptations that help deep ocean fish to survive.
The first adaptation is through their body features. For instance, eels have enormous mouths which help them to eat something bigger than themselves. In this way, they can sustain longer time between eating.
The second adaptation is to generate light. Angler fish can generate light in front of its mouth. In this way, they can lure other smaller fish to them and then catch them.
Those are the two kinds of adaptations that fish used to survive in the deep sea.
