The lecturer explains how the second interest strategy affects businessmen selling their products.
First, it may lead to consumers immediately buying something. For example, a computer store gives games to customers if they buy a computer. Some consumers may purchase the computer because they are interested in the game.
Second, the second interest strategy can keep customers back in the store. For instance, the PC store gives free lessons to customers. As a result, a lot of customers may maintain contact with the store, and in the future, they may buy something, such as a printer from the store.
