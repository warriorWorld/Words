The lecturer explains two adaptations that sea birds used to find their food. 
The first bird is the albatross. Albatrosses have a pair of very long wings which could help them cover extremely long distances above the sea with little energy consumption. Other birds have to move their short wings up and down constantly, But albatrosses don't have to do this, they can glide a lot. And they can fly 100 miles per day.
The second bird is fulmars who has a very sensitive sense of smell. And their food, plankton has a distinctive odour, fulmars can easily find the plankton from a very long distance even though they don't see it.
