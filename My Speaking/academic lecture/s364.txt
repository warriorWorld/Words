The lecturer explains how animals adapt to hot and dry summers by giving two examples.
In the hot summer, snails will take shelter in vegetation in order to shade themselves from the sunlight, or they can climb up to off-grounds, because off-grounds are cooler than the ground.
And in the dry summer, snails could secrete calcium to close up their shells. In this way, they can keep the moisture in their shells. In addition, they can hide in their shells for several months without eating anything, and when the climate became moist again, they would open up the cover.
