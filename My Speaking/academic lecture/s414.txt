The lecturer explains how play benefits children by giving two examples.
First, she mentioned that children always feel helpless, because they have to rely on parents with everything, such as clothes and food. But when they are playing, they feel control, because they can decide which one to play and how to play it. For example, they can construct buildings with blocks.
Second, play gives children a safe way to express a certain urge, namely, destructive. If children destroy something, their parents will get upset about them. But play allows destructive. For instance, children can destroy their block buildings with no harm done.
