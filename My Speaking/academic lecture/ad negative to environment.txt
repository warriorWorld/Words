The lecturer explains environmental problems related to advertising by giving two examples.
First, there is a lot of paper waste that is associated to advertising. For instance, the professor once received an advertisement about remodelling your kitchen even though she didn't own a kitchen. And there are a lot of people similar to her, this makes the trash can full of the advertisement.
Second, advertising boards generally block the scenery behind it. For example, when you drive through a road, and there is an advertising board blocking the beautiful environment, this is awful.
