The lecturer explains how some fish could utilize electricity to benefit its survival by giving two examples.
First she mentioned some fish uses electricity to help itself capturing prey. For example, electricity eel could use its electricity to shock and paralyse its prey.
Second, she said some water is muddy, and some fish's eyesight is poor. As a result, some fish have developed a method for navigation. For instance, night fish could use its electricity to detect if its front has rocks.  When electricity hits a rock, it would create turbulence, and the night fish could detect that turbulence and then avoid the rock.
