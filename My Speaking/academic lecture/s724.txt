The lecturer explains features that young animals used in order to survive in the wild.
The first one is by using camouflage. For instance, when lions are young, their fur can help them blend into the grasslands of Africa.
The second one is through using an unusual way to move or move very quickly. For example, there is a kind of bird who lives on water. And when they are young they can climb trees using their special features. And when they grow up, when they can fly, they will lose their ability to climb trees.
