The lecturer explains two hypotheses about the extinction of dinosaurs.
The first theory is the lacking food theory. It states that when an asteroid crashed the earth, it made a lot of debris that covered the sky. And prevented the sun rays from reaching the surface of the earth. As a result, plants cannot photosynthesis anymore, and a lot of plants died, then herbivores died because of lack of food, and then, carnivores died also.
The second hypothesis is the global warming hypothesis. It states that carbon dioxide keeps heat in the atmosphere from escaping and leads to global warming. And he mentioned that reptiles cannot produce female generations when the temperature is too high, the professor mentioned that a lot of scientists think that dinosaurs maybe are the same as reptiles.
