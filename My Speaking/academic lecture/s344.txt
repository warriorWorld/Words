The lecturer explains how frogs adapt to dry environments in two ways.
The first method is using some material to cover their body in order to prevent water from escaping. For example, there is a kind of frog that can secrete fatty in order to cover their body. And by this wax-like layer, they can prevent water from evaporate.
The second method is storing water inside their bodies, for instance,  there is a kind of frog that can store water in their bladder and then release the water into their organs. In this way, they can live without extra water for several months. And this will help them to live through the dry seasons.
