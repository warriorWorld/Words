The lecturer explains two strategies that can make students follow rules.
The first one is by clarifying why you make the rule. For instance, the professor has taught elementary school students. And she didn't allow students eating in the classroom. She told the students snacks could attract insects and damage books.
The second one is by making students make commitments toward the rules. For example, the professor wrote down the  rules on paper and let students sign their names on the paper. And put the paper on the wall. By using those two strategies, students followed the rules very well.
