The student suggests students do mandatory community service before they graduate in his letter. He thinks this will help to build a relationship between the school and the town, and he considers those who do mandatory activities will eventually build enthusiasm toward community services even after they graduated from school.
However, the man doesn't agree with this letter, he says that students who are forced to do community work will only think of it as a nuisance and will likely do their work halfheartedly. Thus it will even be detrimental to the relationship between the school and the town
Second, the man says that students who are forced to do community service will eventually love to do it is ridiculous. He mentioned that students already complain that they don't have enough time to do their studying, and now they are forced to do community service. They will only build hatred toward community services.
