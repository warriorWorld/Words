According to the letter, the university will send e-mails of the campus activity information everyday. This is because instead of reading a weekly updated newspaper, students can get more up-to-date information from a daily e-mail. And also, students are more comfortable with this kind of communication method.
There are two reasons why the woman agrees with this idea.
First, she mentioned she would read the newspaper every Monday, and soon, she would forget all the activity information. Thus, she thinks daily sending e-mail is obviously better than a weekly updated newspaper.
Second, she said that everyone would check their e-mail at least once per day. And if the school put the cafeteria menu information into the e-mail, people would be even more willing to check the e-mail.
