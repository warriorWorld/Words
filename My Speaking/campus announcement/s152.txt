The author of the letter suggests the university paves its dirt road for two reasons. The first is for safety reasons, the author mentioned whenever it is raining, the road is very slippery and it is dangerous. And second, he thinks it will attract more students if the university paved it.
There are two reasons why the man in the conversation thinks it is a terrible idea.
First, he mentioned that it is detrimental to students health in the long-term for students to run on a hard surface. The hard surface of the road will cause human bones and joints to get injured.
Second, he believes people love the nature look of the road more compared to paved roads.
