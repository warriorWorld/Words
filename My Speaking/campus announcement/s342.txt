According to the letter, the university will provide a free tutoring program in order to help students who just graduated from high schools to familiarize themselves with university's lifestyles. And it will also let students help students.
There are two reasons why the woman agrees with this idea.
First, she thinks that the program can help students to learn how to handle exams, and how to take notes. In addition, she believes that a lot of students indeed need that kind of help.
Second, she thinks the program can help students to select professors. This is because those students who act as tutors can provide information about professors  from a student point of view.
