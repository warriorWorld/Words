The author of the letter suggests the university prevents students from doing sports on the dining hall lawn. In this way, they can keep the lawn nice, and also, students have other playgroud for sports.
There are two reasons why the woman in the conversation disagrees with this idea.
First, she believes that it is not those students' fault that the lawn was destroyed but those students who always cross the lwan to classrooms. Because they are in a hurry to classes.
Second, she mentioned that the playgroud is really far away from classrooms. As a result, students cannot doing sports between classes since they only have a little time to kill.
