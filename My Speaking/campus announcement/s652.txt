According to the letter, the university will match roommates based on their interests. In this way, they can get along, and also without changing their rooms frequently.
There are two reasons why the woman in the conversation disagrees with this idea.
First, she believes that students don't need to have the same interest in order to become friends. For instance, her roommate loves sports and is a French major, and herself doesn't like sports and is a biochemical major. But they can get along.
Second, she mentioned students don't move out because they cannot tolerate each other but because they have different schedules or they want the best location.
