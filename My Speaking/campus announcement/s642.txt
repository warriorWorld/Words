According to the letter, the university will build a cafeteria in the library's basement. This is because students can eat there without the need to walk all the way to the other eatery, and also students could enjoy their leisure time after their research.
There are two reasons why the woman in the conversation disagrees with this idea.
First, she mentioned that students still need to walk all the way down to the basement, and also, if the weather is bad, the basement environment will be terrible. And also the Cafe will only sell junk food.
Second, she believes that when you know that your friends are enjoying their chats in the Cafe you cannot concentrate on your research.
