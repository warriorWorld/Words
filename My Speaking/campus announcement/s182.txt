According to the letter, the university choir will compete with other schools next year. This is because the school thinks this will motivate students and will also increase the university's reputation.
There are two reasons why the man in the conversation agrees with this idea.
First, he thinks students will be motivated by this competition. And he mentioned they only practise once per week now. He thinks they will practise more after this.
Second, he thinks in this way more students will be attracted by the choir. Because if they heard the choir play, and considered it good, they would join too.
