The author of the letter suggests the university builds a cafeteria in the math building. This is because students could eat in the cafeteria between classes, and they could also recharge their laptops in the cafeteria.
There are two reasons why the woman in the conversation agrees with this idea.
First, she believes that it is very convenient to have a cafeteria in the math building because right now, students have to cross the entire campus in order to reach the nearest cafeteria, and they cannot comeback within time.
Second, she mentioned that most students would bring their laptops to classes, especially the math class. In addition, the math building is too old, and it doesn't have enough electrical outlets for students.
