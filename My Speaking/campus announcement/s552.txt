According to the letter, the university requires students doing community services in the future, this is because they think students will feel satisfied in the work, and also, the work places are very near the school.
There are two reasons why the woman in the conversation disagrees with this idea.
First, she believes that when students do things mandatorily they will have resentment toward the work. And when they fulfil the service, they will not do anything like this anymore in the future.
Second, she mentioned that some service locations are really far away, such as the parking lot, and she and a lot of students don't have cars, so it is very inconvenient for them to do the community services.
