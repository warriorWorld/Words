The author of the letter suggests the university allows him and his friends holding a free concert on the university's lawn. This is because he believes that students will enjoy the music between classes, and also he thinks that the lawn is a good place to hold a concert.
There are two reasons why the woman in the conversation disagrees with this idea.
First, she mentioned students are really busy between classes, they don't have enough time to watch a concert, and she thinks that the concert should start in the evening.
Second, she considers that the concert should hold indoors, this is because if so many people crowd on the lawn, the grass will die, and the lawn will turn muddy.
