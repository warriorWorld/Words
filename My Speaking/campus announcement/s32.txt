According to the letter, the university will no longer provide hot breakfasts for students. This is because they believe that cold breakfasts are healthier than hot breakfasts, and also, they think this can help students save money.
There are two reasons why the woman in the conversation disagrees with this idea.
First, she believes that food being healthy or not does not depend on whether it is hot or cold. And she mentioned during a cold winter, people like to eat hot cereal rather than cold yogurt.
Second, she thinks it will not help students save money, since students have to buy breakfast off campus in order to purchase what they want to eat. And food from off campus is usually more expensive.
