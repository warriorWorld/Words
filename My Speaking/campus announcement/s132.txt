According to the letter, the university will spend two million dollars in order to build a new athletic stadium. This is because the university thinks this will attract more students and also in this way, the university can have more seats available for local communities.
There are two reasons why the woman in the conversation disagrees with this idea.
First, she mentioned the laboratory needs more equipment, the library needs more books and the student centre is too small for students. She believes the university should spend the money on those things.
Second, she thinks that the fact there are not so many people went to watch the games in the school is because their team always loses the games. As a result, even if the university provides more seats for local communities, they wouldn't come to watch the games.
