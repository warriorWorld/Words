According to the letter, the university announced it will change its orientation program in two ways. First, it will provide students with a choice between hiking and group games. Second, it will reduce the program duration from two days to just one day.
The man agrees with this change for two reasons. First, he says that we all love choices, and not everyone likes something such as hiking. Second, he mentioned that students all love to have weekends, because they could use weekends to do things such as buying some books, setting up rooms, and preparing for classes before classes begin.
