The author of the letter suggests the university delay its music practice room close time from 9:00 to midnight. This is because the room is the only place students can practise their music, and in this way, more students could use that room to practise.
There are two reasons why the woman agrees with this idea.
First, she mentioned when she practices her violin she has to keep the voice down, otherwise, she will disturb others who are sleeping or studying.
Second, she mentioned there is a whole orchestra team that needs the practice room, as a result, she often cannot book the room successfully.
