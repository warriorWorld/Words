The author of the letter suggests the university cancels its information sessions. This is because students will forget all the information very quickly soon after the sessions, and also the university has already provided a website that contains all the information.
There are two reasons why the woman in the conversation disagrees with this idea.
First, she mentioned she got the book fair information from the sessions. And she has saved a lot of money, because she can buy used books that other students don't need anymore at the book fair.
Second, she believes that it is unrealistic to let students get information from the university website, because students don't have the habit of browsing the website at all.
