According to the letter, the university will cancel its evening class due to low numbers of enrolment and the surveys showing that students don't like the assistant's teaching.
However, the man disagrees with this change for two reasons.
First, he mentioned he knows a lot of students like the assistant's teaching, and he doesn't know where the surveys surveyed. In addition, he believes that the involvement of the class is better when there are only a few students.
Second, he thinks that the assistant's teaching is good because the assistant doesn't have a lot of experience, and this makes his class more exciting compared to the professors who teaching the same class for more than twenty years.
