According to the letter, students will not be allowed to put their posters at the student centre. This is because the posters have a bad effect on the building's appearance, and students could put their posters near the dining hall.
However, there are two reasons why the woman disagrees with this letter.
First, she said that without the posters the building was so boring, and with the posters the building is colourful and has its own personality. In addition, with the posters the building is always changing.
Second, she mentioned that almost no students eat in the dining hall, students usually eat at the snack bar. Thus, there is no point putting those posters near the dining hall.
