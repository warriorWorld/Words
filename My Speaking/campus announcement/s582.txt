The author of the letter suggests the university book store sells snacks and drinks. This is because students can select books while eating something, and also students can buy some food to eat between classes.
There are two reasons why the woman in the conversation disagrees with this idea.
First, she believes that it is unavoidable to spill some food on the books and ruin them. In addition, a lot of books are really expensive.
Second, she mentioned that a food store is already available in the school, and the store is very near the classroom building. On the other hand, the book store is very far away from the classroom building. So it will make no sense to let the book store sell food and drinks.
