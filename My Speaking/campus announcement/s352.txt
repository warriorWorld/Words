The author of the letter suggests the university allows students to audit classes. Because he thinks students can develop new interests in other majors by this, and he considers this wouldn't add new works to professors.
However, there are two reasons why the woman disagrees with this idea.
First, she states that those audit students will ask basic questions, while the other students already read the relevant background knowledge.
Second, she believes that professors will also be affected by this policy. Because they have to prepare extra handouts, and have to answer a lot of basic questions from those audit students.
