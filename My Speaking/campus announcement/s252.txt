According to the letter, the university will separate its graduation ceremony into two parts.
However, there are two reasons why the woman disagrees with this idea.
First, she thinks the ceremony is too long in time only because there are too many speeches in the ceremony, all the students, teachers, and president speeches, and a lot of them are very boring and meaningless. The school should reduce all unnecessary speeches in order to reduce its duration.
Second, about the space the ceremony takes. She believes the school should only allow students inviting 6 people instead of 10 people to the ceremony. You know, most schools only allow students inviting 4 or 5 people to their ceremonies.
