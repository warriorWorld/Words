According to the letter, the university newspaper will remove its foreign news section next month. This is because people can read foreign news from other outlets and the newspaper could replace the foreign news section with a calendar.
There are two reasons why the woman agrees with this idea.
First, she mentioned almost no one would read that section, and even if they like to read that section, before they read it, they already knew that news from the internet and other newspapers.
Second, she mentioned that the school activity information is scattered around the university buildings, and it is very inconvenient for students to gather all the information. But if the newspaper covers that information in its calendar section, things would change.
