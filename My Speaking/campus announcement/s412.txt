Accoding to the assignment, the teacher requires students to do a project with a partner. And the teacher thinks this will help students study teamwork.
However, there are two reasons why the woman disagrees with this assignment.
First, she said depending on someone else really makes her nervous. And she mentioned her roommate who did the project last year. She has to do all the work by herself, because of her partner's unreliability, and that really hurts her grades.
Second, she mentioned that students are extremely preoccupied with the exam, and they have no spare time for the presentation. The professor would be disappointed because of this.
