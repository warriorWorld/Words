The author of the letter suggests the university shortens its history seminars from 3 hours to 2 hours. This is because people cannot concentrate for that long time without becoming bored, and also people would do a lot of other things during the last hour of the seminars.
There are two reasons why the woman in the conversation disagrees with this idea.
First, she believes that the author of the letter is a terrible student, he always has a party every night. And last year, she and he were classmates, she always noticed that he was sleeping during classes. As a result, he cannot represent all the other students.
Second, she mentioned that the last hour of the seminars is the most interesting part of the seminar. People would discuss a lot of interesting things during that time.
