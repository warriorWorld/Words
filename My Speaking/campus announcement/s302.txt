The author of the letter suggests the university puts their construction schedules in summer break. Because he thinks the construction has caused a lot of disturbances to both professors and students. And he also thinks in the summer the construction can go faster than in the winter.
There are two reasons why the woman agrees with this idea.
First, she mentioned last time, when the construction was going on, she cannot find a parking lot, because all the 4 parking lots were under construction, she and a professor were late because of this.
Second, she mentioned last year the big snow storm had caused a lot of trouble with the construction. And if the construction schedule was taken in the summer, there wouldn't be so much trouble involved.
