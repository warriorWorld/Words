According to the letter, the school will build a new lighting system for the historical building. However, the letter disagrees with this change. This is because it will spend 1000 dollars per month just for electricity, and the sky will be too bright for astronomy students to observe the sky.
There are two reasons why the man agrees with the letter.
First of all, he argues that it is a waste of money for just looks. And we can spend that money on renovating the building.
Moreover, he mentions that if the lighting system were built, astronomy students will not be able to observe stars with a telescope because the sky will be too bright to do so. And students will have to observe stars in pictures.
