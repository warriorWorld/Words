The author of the letter suggests the university limits its book borrow time from one month to two weeks. This is because he believes that students don't need one month in order to read just one book, and also, in this way, students can get the book that they want more quickly than before.
There are two reasons why the woman in the conversation disagrees with this idea.
First, she mentioned when students use books as reference books, they have to recheck the books even a month later in order to go back and check the information that they need.
And Second, she mentioned because of the interlib law, students can get the book that they want from other schools' libraries in a few days, they just need to put the name and the author info of the book on a website.
