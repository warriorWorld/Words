The letter suggests the university publish the professor evaluation results. This is because the author thinks professors would want others to know their teaching styles, and students also could benefit from the publish.
However, there are two reasons why the woman disagrees with this idea.
First, she said professors would not want their teaching styles being criticized in public, and they won't take the evaluation seriously.
Second, she mentioned students generally check the professor evaluation results on the last day of class, and they all want to go home quickly. As a result, this publish would not likely benefit students either.
