According to the letter, the university will let students use electronic books instead of paper books. 
There are two reasons why the woman disagrees with this letter.
First, she believes it is unrealistically to do so, because even though the device only costs 200 dollars, students maybe need new ones since the device may be broken in the future, or they just want new features in the new devices.
Second, she mentioned the screen of the device is too small for students, and the control buttons also are very small, it is hard to control and it is hard to highlight texts if you are using this device.
