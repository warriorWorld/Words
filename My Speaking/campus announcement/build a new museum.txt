The letter suggests the university builds a new museum in the school. This is because it could help students to learn fine art and the school can collect the money needed from donations.
However, there are two reasons why the man disagrees with this idea.
First, he said you can just spend one and half hours going to the downtown museum, and it has a lot of exquisite arts as well. And you can purchase the ticket at half price as a student, and even free on Monday.
Second, he  mentioned that the donators already donated a lot of money to aid the school to construct its student center, and its library. And we shouldn't request the donators to donate to an unnecessary museum.
