According to the letter, the university will remove all the books that haven't been borrowed by students for 5 years, and digitize them.
There are two reasons why the woman in the conversation agrees with this idea.
First, she mentioned that she had worked for the library, and she knew all the shelves were crowded with books and the library staff had to climb a lot during their work. In addition, a lot of books didn't even go to shelves and just piled up.
Second, she believes that the online versions of those books are really convenient for students, since students don't even need to go to library if they want to read some books, they can browse those books in their dormitories. And she hopes that all the books have online versions.
