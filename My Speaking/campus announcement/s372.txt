The author of the letter suggests the university cancels its room phones in the dormitory rooms. This is due to students all having their own mobile phones, and students can save the service money from this cancellation.
There are two reasons why the woman disagrees with this idea.
First, she thinks that it is good to have a back-up phone, this is because the school's communication service isn't good, it always cuts up when they are communicating.
Second, she mentioned that students only have to pay for the service per call, this means if you don't use it a lot, you don't have to pay much for it.
