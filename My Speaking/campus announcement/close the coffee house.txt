The author of the letter suggests the university closes the coffee house. This is because there are not so many people going to the coffee house, and the lights there are really dark for studying.
However, there are two reasons why the woman disagrees with this letter.
First, she said it is true that during the day the coffee house has only a few customers. But in the evening there are a lot of people hanging out there, studying there, and doing jobs there. This is due to students only having leisure time in the evenings.
Second, she mentioned that the coffee house recently had been renovated. As a result, the lights there are as bright as a library now. Though only a few seats are bright.
