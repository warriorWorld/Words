According to the letter, the university will replace its big table in the library with separate individual tables. In this way, students can concentrate more on studying, and also the library can provide more seats for students.
There are two reasons why the man in the conversation disagrees with this idea.
First, he believes in this way, the study group can no longer study together. And he suggests the university builds a meeting room instead of this.
Second, he thinks the overcrowding problem doesn't exist at all. Because he often has the whole table on his own, and the woman in the conversation also has similar experiences.
