The author of the letter thinks that the university should make its Sutdent Plays free to everyone, not just students and employees. It states that this will benefit not just the surrounding towns people, but also students who play the plays can have a large audience.
There are two reasons why the man agrees with this idea.
First, the man mentioned that the town people don't have many things to do when they are free, and the only professional theatre is too far away, besides, the ticket costs 40 dollars.
Second, he thinks that the free Plays will also benefit the students who play the Plays with a large audience. For instance, when students play a comedy, they want the audience to laugh at the jokes, it is really  embarrassing  if the theater is half-empty.
