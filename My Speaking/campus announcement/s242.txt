The author of the letter suggests the university remove its coffee house from the school. This is because not so many people go there regularly, and the food there is really terrible.
However, there are two reasons why the woman disagrees with this idea.
First, she said the coffee house being always so empty is exactly why she likes it. She loves to study there or get work done there rather than in a library.
Second, she believes the author of the letter must never be there recently, because the coffee house just changed its manager and the food there now is really delicious and also healthy.
