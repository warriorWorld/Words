According to the letter, the university will increase its student fee for the use of recreation center by 25 dollars. This is because they can use that money to buy some new equipment, and they think 25 dollars is affordable for most students.
There are two reasons why the man agrees with this idea.
First, he believes that the fact only a few people went to the recreation centre regularly is caused by the old equipment and also there are a lot of them already broken down.
Second, he thinks 25 dollars is not so much, since students often buy some CDs and watch some movies. And also, the 25 dollars is for a whole year.
