The author of the letter suggests the university changes its bicycle borrowing program in two ways. First, shorten the borrowing duration to four hours, second, let students use their student cards instead of money in the program.
There are two reasons why the man disagrees with this idea.
First, he mentioned people often need more time using the bicycle. For example, he often needs the bicycle for the whole day in order to hike a mountain.
Second, he mentioned students must use their student cards in order to enter some buildings, such as the laboratory building and the dining hall.
