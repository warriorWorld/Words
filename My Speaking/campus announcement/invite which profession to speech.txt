The letter suggests the school invite a businessman to the speech. This is because business leaders always make important decisions, and a speech by a business leader is good for the school's business program.
However, the student disagree with the letter for two reasons.
First, the student said that the school always invites a businessman to the speech, at least since she came to the school, this is true. In addition, the student suggests the school invite other professionals to the speech, such as a teacher.
Secondly, the student believes that inviting a teacher to the speech is beneficial to the school's education program. And since the school's business program is already big enough and well-known, it doesn't need advertising.
