The author of the letter suggests the university let students decide which student organization should be funded and how much it should be funded.
However, there are two reasons why the man disagrees with this letter.
First, he said students are too close to the situation, and they are not objective with the funds. As a result, they will fund their friends or themselves. In addition, he said the school administrators are fairer than students at this kind of thing.
Second, he mentioned almost no one wanted to join the committee because they don't have enough time, and even now, the vice-president position is still empty.
