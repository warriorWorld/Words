According to the letter, the university will initiate a ride share program. Because it can save the environment, and it will also help students save a lot of money.
There are two reasons why the woman agrees with this idea.
First, she said the program not only can help students save money from gas spending, but also can help students save a lot of car repair fees.
Second, she mentioned the street already has so much traffic on it, and with that much traffic there will also be a lot of CO2 discharging. And she thinks that the ride share program can help us to reduce air pollution, and improve the condition of the air.
