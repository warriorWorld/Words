The author of the letter suggests the university allows students to eat in classrooms for two reasons. First, when students are hungry, they cannot concentrate on class. Second, if they are allowed eating in classrooms, they can hold a party on the last day of class.
There are two reasons why the man in the conversation disagrees with this idea.
First, even though the one who eats something can concentrate more on class, others will be affected by the noise of eating.
Second, he mentioned the last day of class is actually very important to students. Students have to use that class to review and prepare for the exams.
