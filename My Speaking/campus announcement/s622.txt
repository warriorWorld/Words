The author of the letter suggests the university builds its new parking lot at Sanders Field. This is because he believes that the place is always empty, and no other use, and he thinks students  can park their cars there.
There are two reasons why the woman in the conversation disagrees with this idea.
First, she considers that the place is very useful for students to relax and study. And she mentioned students don't have enough space to hang on campus.
Second, she thinks that the university already has enough parking spaces for students and teachers. And also, Sanders Field is too far away from the main part of the campus, it takes 15 minutes to commute to the main part of the campus.
