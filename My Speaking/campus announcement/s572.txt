The author of the letter suggests the university elongates its studying time before the exams. This is because students don't have enough time to study before the exams, and also, students could ask professors questions during that time.
There are two reasons why the woman in the conversation disagrees with this idea.
First, she believes that students shouldn't wait until that time to study, they should prepare for the exams beforehand.
Second, she mentioned professors are really busy during that time, they need to prepare for the exams. As a result, students shouldn't ask their professors questions during that time.
