According to the letter, the university will let cooking students cook for a short period of time in the dining hall. In this way, cooking students can have the chance to practise their skills, the school also mentioned they will increase the prices a little bit.
There are two reasons why the man in the conversation agrees with this idea.
First, he mentioned his cousin who joined the program a few years ago, and he said cooking for a lot of people is a lot different compared to cooking for just a few people. In other words, this is a good opportunity for students to practise.
Second, he believes that compared to those fancy restaurants, the prices of the dining hall are much cheaper.
