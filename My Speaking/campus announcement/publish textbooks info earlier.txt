The letter suggests the university publish its textbooks' information earlier, such as before registration. This is because it will help students save some money, and students can study before registration.
There are two reasons why the man agrees with this letter.
First, he said that old books always sell off very quickly, and if students have the time, they can look around, and buy some cheap books from the internet.
Secondly, he mentioned that students often get very busy after registration. And if students have those textbooks before the registration, they could study before the registration.
