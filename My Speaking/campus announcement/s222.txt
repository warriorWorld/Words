According to the letter the university will let students instead of staff guide other students on the university's tour. This is because the university's staff is very busy, and in this way, students can provide a student perspective on the school.
There are two reasons why the woman agrees with this idea.
First, she mentioned the staff is really busy, they have to constantly answer phones, and also have a lot of paperwork to do.
Second, she mentioned when she visited the school, the guide didn't know if the dormitory was noisy or not, and didn't know if the cafeteria was good or not. Thus, she thinks it is better to provide students with a student perspective on the university.
