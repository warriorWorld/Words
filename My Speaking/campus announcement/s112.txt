According to the letter, the university will renovate its dormitories in order to improve the conditions of the bathrooms and improve the lighting and heating systems.
There are two reasons why the woman in the conversation disagrees with this idea.
First, she believes that the noise of the construction will disturb students constantly for two years. As a result, students will move out of the campus in order to avoid the noise.
And second, she thinks even the construction has completed in the future. Students will not live there because the school will raise the rent fee. As a result, students will rent  houses off campus.
