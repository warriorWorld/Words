According to the letter, the university will hold a concert in the music building for free. This is because they think this will help students who practise music have an opportunity to perform music in a real concert, and also they will provide free snacks for students.
There are two reasons why the woman in the conversation agrees with this idea.
First, she mentioned since she started to practise music, she only gets one chance to perform in a concert, and in the concert each student can only perform one piece of that concert. In other words, she thinks that the upcoming concert is a good opportunity for students who practise musical instruments.
Second, she believes that the snacks are good for students, because they don't have enough time to eat between classes, and also the music building is far away from the class building, it takes 15 minutes to walk to the class building.
