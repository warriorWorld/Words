According to the letter, the university will open its graduate study lounge to all students. This is because the place right now is under utilizing, and also students besides graduate students don't have enough space to study.
There are two reasons why the woman in the conversation disagrees with this idea.
First, she likes the place right now being really quiet and also she can spread all her books on the big table. She thinks if the place is open to every student, it will be very noisy and crowded.
Second, she believes if the school needs more space for students they should build a new one, and the newly built dormitory is a good place for it.
