The author of the letter suggests the university provides a free commute between the school and the airport. This is because there is not any public transportation available between the school and the airport, and he thinks the school can use the school buses in order to do this.
There are two reasons why the man agrees with this idea.
First, he mentioned since the university is located outside the city, they can only rely on taxis in order to go to the airport, and it is very expensive for students, it will cost 30 dollars eachtime.
Second, he mentioned that the school buses which are used for commuting between buildings are of very little use after exams. So it would cause no harm to the school or students if we used those buses.
