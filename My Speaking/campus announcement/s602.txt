The author of the letter suggests the university improves its dormitory kitchen conditions in two ways. First, improve its kitchen utensils. Second, provide cooking lessons for students.
There are two reasons why the man in the conversations agrees with this idea.
First, he mentioned that he once encountered a rain storm, and when he returned to the dormitory, he wanted a cup of warm tea, but he could only find an old teapot and without tea cups.
Second, he thinks those students who have cooking skills can teach those who don't. And he believes that learning cooking together is fun.
