According to the letter, the university business studies department requires students to have real work experience before next semester. This is because they believe this kind of experience can help students study a lot of things, and also they may get employed permanently by companies.
There are two reasons why the woman in the conversation disagrees with this idea.
She mentioned her brother who had already experienced this kind of thing. He only did a lot of basic things, such as typing and finding stuff. As a result, she believes this kind of experience has no actual use for students.
Second, she mentioned a lot of schools already required students to do similar things. So, there are not enough job opportunities for students.
