The author of the letter suggests the university remove all the old bicycles from the campus racks. He thinks no one wanted those bikes anymore, and by dispose them, we can save a lot of space for students.
There are two reasons why the woman agrees with this idea.
First, she thinks no one needed those bikes anymore because some of them lost their handlebars, some of them lost their wheels, and the rest of them are rusting. And besides, she thinks the university could notify students ahead of time for two weeks, in this way, no one will be hurt.
Second, she mentioned that the university has prohibited students from locking their bicycles in sign poles and fences. As a result, a lot of students do need more space for them to lock their bicycles, especially around the dining hall.
