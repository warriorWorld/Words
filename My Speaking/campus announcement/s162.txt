The author of the letter suggests the government improves student health services in two ways. First, hire more employees, Second, provide services not only on Monday and Friday but also at weekends.
There are two reasons why the man in the conversation disagrees with this idea.
First, he mentioned the service center is too tiny for more doctors.
Second, he believes when weekends arrive, there are not so many people who have the demand for the health service, because during the weekends, most students are already going back home.
