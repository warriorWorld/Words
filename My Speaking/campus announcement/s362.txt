The author of the letter suggests that the university allows students to carry laptops to classes. This is because most students could type faster than writing, and with computers, students could take notes faster. And also, in this way, students could look for related information on the internet during classes.
However, there are two reasons why the man disagrees with this suggestion.
First, he believes that students will pay less attention to classes , if they bring laptops in classes. This is because they could use laptops to surf the internet, and play games.
Second, he mentioned that not all students have laptops, thus, if professors use laptops as tools for classes, those who have no laptops would not be able to follow.
