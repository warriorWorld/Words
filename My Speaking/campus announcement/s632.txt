According to the letter, the university will have a new website available, the website can help students check their class information, and also advisors can spare their time.
There are two reasons why the man in the conversation agrees with this idea.
First, he mentioned students usually have a lot of different classes, and it is convenient to have a website to check out. He mentioned his friend who had to return to the school after his summer break because he missed a certain class. And his friend had to graduate a few months later.
Second, he mentioned that all the advisors are professors, and as a result, they are extremely busy. If they can save their time, they can use that time to answer student's questions such as internship related questions or change major related questions.
