According to the letter, the university will construct a lounge for commuter students. It states that the lounge will provide commuter students with a place to gather and rest, and it will also provide a bulletin board for students to share information.
There are two reasons why the woman agrees with this idea.
First, she mentioned that the school's dormitories already have some lounges. And dormitory students love the lounge, they gather there to meet some friends and rest there. She believes that the new lounge will also be a success.
Second, she said the bulletin board will also be useful, because students could share route information there, in this way, they can share a car with others, it will also save money for students.
