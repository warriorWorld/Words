According to the letter, the university will add an evening computer class in order to guarantee students all have the chance to take a computer class even though they have to pay more. 
There are two reasons why the man in the conversation disagrees with this idea.
First, he mentioned that students are usually very busy during evenings, they have to do a lot of jobs and have to accompany their family members, and do a lot of evening activities.
Second, he believes that it is very expensive to hire more teachers in order to satisfy the evening class. And he suggests the university purchases more computers and puts those computers in the classroom, and since the classroom is very big, it can contain those computers.
