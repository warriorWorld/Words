The author of the letter suggests the university displays its student art in the lobby. This is because a lot of people would pass by the building regularly, and since the building's outer wall is made of glass, the natural light in the building is good.
There are two reasons why the woman in the conversation disagrees with this idea.
First, she said it is true that a lot of people would pass by, but it also means that the place is crowded all the time. As a result, you cannot concentrate on art because of all the people walking through you.
Second, she mentioned in reality, the natural light actually isn't good for the art display. This is because the natural light is sometimes too bright for the art display, and sometimes, when the weather is cloudy, the light would be too dark for the art display. Almost all museums would use artificial light in order to be able to carefully control the light source.
