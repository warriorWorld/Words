According to the letter, the student association will purchase a new sound system and install it in the Old Lincoln Hall. This is because they believe students love to watch movies.
There are two reasons why the man in the conversation disagrees with this idea.
First, he thinks that Old Lincoln Hall is too old. He says that Old Lincoln Hall must be 200 years old and its acoustic environment is terrible.
Second, he mentioned that students love to watch movies is not because they really love movies but because they don't have many things to do on campus. And if they have other social activities or other recreation activities to do, they will not watch movies.
