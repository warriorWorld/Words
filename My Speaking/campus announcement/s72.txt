According to the reading, the university will eliminate its sculpture courses for two reasons. First, only a few students have taken the courses, and the sculpture teacher will retire soon, and it makes no sense to hire a new teacher just for a few students.
The woman in the conversation considers this a big loss for students.
First, most students didn't take those courses it is because the courses are optional, and they don't have enough time to take those courses, they have to put the painting and the other courses as the first priority.
Second, she believes that the school can hire a part time teacher in order to save money, or just let the already existing teachers teach the sculpture courses. She mentioned a lot of teachers have their secondary field, such as the painting teacher who actually can teach the sculpture courses.
