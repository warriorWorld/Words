The reading is about cognitive dissonance. It states that when people have contradictions between their beliefs and their behaviors, they usually will not change their behaviors but change their beliefs in order to suit their behaviors.
The professor mentioned himself as an example of this. When he was a first year high school student, he really enjoyed games, and because of this he failed a lot of classes, especially chemistry. He believes students should have good scores in every class. He changed this belief in order to persuade himself that he can play games as he wants. He told himself that he wanted to become a sociologist not a chemist.
