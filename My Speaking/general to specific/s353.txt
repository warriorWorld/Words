The reading is about integrated farming. Integrated farming is a method that allows animals and plants to be raised together and eventually benefits both of them.
The professor elaborates on this by giving an example.
He mentioned that some farmers put chicken in a little house that has no floor but wheels. In this way, the chicken could walk around along with the little house. And farmers could put the little houses on fields, in this way, chicken could eat weeds and wild plants, and also the soil condition could be improved. Then farmers could plant bean plants on the field. And because the weeds are removed, no other plants could compete with the bean plants with sunlight and water.
