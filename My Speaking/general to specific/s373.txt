The reading is about communal nutrition, it states that some kind of insects would find food selectively in order to satisfy their community's demand.
The professor elaborates on this by giving two examples.
First, he mentioned that forage ants will gather food that is rich in sugar, such as fruits, if their community is dominated by adults. This is because adult ants require more energy to work.
Second, forage ants will collect food that is rich in protein, such as leaves and mushrooms. when their nest is dominated by baby ants. This is caused by baby ants needing more protein to grow.
