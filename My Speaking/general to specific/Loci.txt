The reading is about a memory method that called Loci. It states that Loci is when you try to remember something, you can associate things with the locations that you are familiar with.
The professor elaborates on this by providing an example.
He said when you try to remember planet names, you could imagine that you walk through from dormitory to student center, there is a big tree and a stature then go to the library. You could associate planet names with those landmarks by order. And when you are in exam, you could try to recall them by just imagining you are walking along the path again.
