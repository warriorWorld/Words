The reading is about state-dependent memory, it states that when people try to recall some memory if the environment is the same or is similar to the environment while the memory is made, they often could recall it very well.
The professor elaborates on this by providing an example.
He said that once upon a time, he had a presentation, he and his classmates try to remember all the key characters of the plants and their names. And when they practice the presentation at school, they do it very well. But when the previous day of the presentation, he practice it at home while his family members were watching TV in the next room. He can not recall the memory well, he was worried. But in the end, the presentation went smoothly, when he was in school and his classmates and teacher were around him.
