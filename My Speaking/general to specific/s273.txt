The reading is about swarm intelligence. It states that some animals live in groups, such as insects, they do things in groups, in this way, they can do things that individuals cannot.
The professor mentioned ants who live in colonies. He mentioned some ants want to reach some food on a tree, and when those ants reach the end of a branch, they cannot cross the branch to reach another branch, because the gap between the two branches is too wide. Then one ant will hold the branch's end, and another ant will hold the previous ant, just like this, a lot of ants hold together, and they could form a bridge, an ants bridge. Then the rest of the ants could cross the bridge and reach the food source.
