The reading is about behavior modification. It states that some behaviors will cause good consequences, and animals will repeat this kind of behavior. And some behaviors will cause bad results, animals will avoid those behaviors.
The professor mentioned kids as an example of this.
He mentioned that  when children first entered school. They often behave badly, such as walking around when the class is going on. And they will get punished by this, such as forbidding them from going out to play, and soon they will know that this kind of behavior will cause trouble to them, and they will avoid this kind of behavior in the future. They will also get praised by the teachers when they behave properly, such as raising their hands when they want to answer a question or paying attention to the class. They will repeat those behaviors because of the reward.
