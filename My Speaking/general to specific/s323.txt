The reading is about choice-supportive bias, it states that when people have already made some decision, they tend to only pay attention to the advantages of that choice, and ignore the disadvantages of that choice.
The professor elaborates on this by giving an example.
He mentioned about 5 or 6 years ago, his friend bought a house, at first, his friend thought the house was small, but the house's location was very good, because it was extremely close to his work place, then he bought it. And a few years later, the professor met his friend and asked him about his opinion about the house again, but this time his friend only mentioned the house's location was good. And the professor mentioned the size of the house, his friend was surprised, because he had already forgotten about his opinion about the size of the house.
