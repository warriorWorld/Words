The reading is about population change, it states that populations change with two factors. First is biotic factors, such as food and predator numbers. Second is abiotic factors, such as environment and sunlight.
The professor elaborates on this by providing two examples.
First, owls are mice's predators, and if there were a lot of owls in a giving time, the mice's number would drop dramatically. 
Second, he mentioned that rabbits would reproduce when winter ends. If winter was very short and the weather got warm quickly. The rabbits will have an extra circle of reproduction period, and their number will increase significantly.
