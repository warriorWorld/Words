The reading is about questioning awareness of effects. It states that when a student does something wrong, the teacher could ask him if he realized that he did something wrong, and then just continues the class.
The professor elaborates on this by giving an example.
He mentioned a girl called Sara. Sara often calls out answers in a class without raising her hand. And there was a time when Sara did this again, and the professor asked her if she realized it was unfair to other students for doing this kind of thing, and then he continued his class. After that, Sara never did this kind of thing again.
