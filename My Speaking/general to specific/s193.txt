The reading is about social learning. It states that people tend to learn something from others, or not learn something from others. It all depends on the consequence.
The professor mentioned a family which has a six year old sister and four year old brother. When they were shopping with their mother, the sister wanted a toy, but the mother said no to her. And then the sister cried and screamed, as a result, the mother bought the toy for her, and the brother saw all of this. So when he wants something, he will probably do the same. By contrast, if the mother didn't buy the toy for the girl, and disciplined her, then prohibit her from watching her favorite TV show  instead. Then the boy will not learn from her.
