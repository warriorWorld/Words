The reading is about the experimenter effect. It states that experimenters might affect experiment results by their expectations.
The professor elaborates on this by giving an example.
He mentioned some scientists give some researchers two groups of monkeys and let them train the monkeys to put balls into baskets. And the scientists told the researchers that one group of monkeys are smarter than the other group even though they have similar intelligence. And the result of the experiment showed that the smarter monkey group trained faster than the monkey group which was deemed as not smart for two hours. This is because the researcher trained the so called smart monkeys with smiles and more encouragement.
