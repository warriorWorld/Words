The reading is about the near field sound detection. It states that some animals could detect vibration that other animals cannot, in this way, they can avoid predators.
The professor elaborates on this by giving an example.
Caterpillars live on tree branches, if a wasp flies near them, they can detect the vibration that the wasp is making with their tiny hairs around their bodies. And they will drop off the branch in order to  escape from the wasp. The wasp may just fly by without noticing the caterpillar.
