The reading is about task partitioning. It states that some animals would separate one task into several parts in order to complete it more easily.
The professor mentioned leaf cutter ants as an example of this. In order to transport leaves which are leaf cutter ants' food to their own nest, leaf cutter ants separate into three groups. The first group would cut leaves down from trees, and form a pile of leaves under trees. The second group would cut those leaves into smaller pieces in order to make it easier to carry, and carry them near their nest. The Final group would carry those leaves into their nest. In this way, leaf cutter ants can transport leaves to their nest more easily.
