The reading is about impression management, it states that impression management happens in daily life when people want to give others a specific impression, they will change their appearance or behaviors.
The professor elaborates on this by providing two examples.
First, he mentions that even students who always wear a jean and a T-shirt, when they are giving a presentation, usually dressed formally. Because they want to give the impression that they prepare the presentation seriously.
Second, he says that once upon a time, he knows that he will give the president a ride on the second day, he cleans the trash at the car's back sit unconsciously, and even washed the car. Because he wants the president to consider he is neat. And when the ride, he turned the radio channel to classical music, he didn't know why, maybe because he thinks that this will give the president the impression that he is sophisticated. In addition, he said he doesn't like classical music.
