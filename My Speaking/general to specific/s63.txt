The reading is about explicit memories and implicit memories. 
The professor elaborates on this by giving two examples.
 Explicit memory is the memory that we are consciously aware of, such as the dinner that we ate last night.
Implicit memory is the kind of memory that we cannot consciously recall. For example, there are a lot of billboards along highways, such as a billboard that shows a car and the name of the car which is "panther". And if you ask those people who just pass by the billboard if they saw the advertisement, a lot of people would answer no. And if you let them name an animal whose letter starts with a P, they will answer panther, even though the pig is a more common answer to this.
