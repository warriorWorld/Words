The reading is about compound nesting. It states that some different species would live together, but because they don't require the same resources, as a result, they don't compete with each other. Sometimes, they even benefit from each other.
The professor mentioned two kinds of ant as an example of this. Those two ant species live in holo tree branches. And one ant species is big while the other being small, the big one would collect food, and eat in the nest. The small one would eat the leftovers of the food. Even it seems only the small one gets benefits from the big one. But the big one also gets benefits from the small one, because, in this way, the small one keeps the nest clean, and prevents becteria from proliferation.
