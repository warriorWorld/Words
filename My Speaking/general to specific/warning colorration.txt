The reading is about warning coloration. It states that when a predator attacks an animal which has a specific coloration, and there after has a negative consequence. The predator would avoid attacking that kind of animal again.
The professor elaborates on this by providing an example.
He mentioned that skunk which is a kind of animal who has a black body with white stripes. Skunks are very easy to see even from long distances. And if a wolf attacked a skunk, the skunk would raise its tail and spray its smelly liquid on the wolf. The wolf feels terrible about the liquid, and will avoid attacking skunks once more, and even running faraway from them.
