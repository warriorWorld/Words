The reading is about negative phototaxis. It states that some animals don't like sunlight and they would avoid being exposed to sunlight.
The professor mentioned earth worms as an example of this. Earth worms live underground, they like moist environments, because they need to maintain their skin to be moist in order to  breathe. If they are exposed to the Sun, their skin will dry out, and this will make them cannot breathe, then they will die. Even though they don't have eyes to see sunlight, they have certain cells to detect sunlight, if they detected sunlight, they would dig down to the ground to escape from sunlight until their cells can no longer detect sunlight.
