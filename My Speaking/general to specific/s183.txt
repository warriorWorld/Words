The reading is about Relict Behavior. It states that some animals will remain some behaviors for thousands of years even though the initial purpose of the behavior has gone a long time ago.
The professor mentioned pronghorns as an example. Pronghorns are a kind of deer-like animal who lives in America. They can run extremely fast, even coyotes cannot catch them. Actually, they are the fastest animals in the western-hemisphere. So, why do they need to be this fast? Turns out, it is because ten thousand years ago, lions existed in America, and they liked to eat pronghorns. Lions are very fast, as a result, pronghorns must be fast too. Today, even though lions have already become extinct in America, prongorns are still this fast.
