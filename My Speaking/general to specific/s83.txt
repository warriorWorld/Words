The reading is about revealing coloration. It states that some animals would hide their bright colors under their body parts, and if a predator is near them, they would show the bright color to the predator by surprise in order to confuse the predator, and then escape from the predator.
The professor elaborates on this by giving two examples.
First, peanut bugs can blend in their environment. And when a predator is near them, they can show their bright colors by opening their back wings and then escaping.
Second, the morpho butterfly has a pair of very shiny wings, when birds are catching them, they can use their shiny wings to reflect the sun light, and this makes the birds have a lot of difficulties following them.
