The reading is about enclothed cognition. It states that when people wear some kind of clothing, not only how they perceive themselves will change, but also their observation ability will change.
The professor elaborates on this by giving an example.
He mentioned an experiment that makes one volunteer wear doctor clothes, the other doesn't. A doctor is an occupation that requires observation ability. And the researcher let them observe the differences between the two pictures. It turns out the one who wore doctor clothes actually finds more differences compared to the one who doesn't wear doctor clothes.
