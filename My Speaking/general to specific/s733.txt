The reading is about generalization to avoid predators. It states that some animals can generalize about their predators in order to avoid similar predators.
The professor mentioned minnows as an example of this.
Minnows are a kind of small fish, their predators include trout. When they smell and detect the trout they will crowd together in order to avoid the predator. And some researchers put two kinds of fish in front of minnows, one kind of fish is another species of trout. As a result, the minnows detected the trout by their smell and crowded together.
