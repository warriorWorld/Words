The reading is about optimal foraging. It states that animals need to minimize their energy consumption and maximize their nutritional gains when they are foraging.
The professor elaborates on this by providing an example. He said there is a kind of crow who lives near rivers. These crows eat shellfish. And They would select the biggest shellfish in order to maximize their nutritional gains, and bring the shellfish up to five meters high, then drop it to the rocks. There is a reason why exactly five meters high, because if higher than five meters, the bird would consume unnecessary energy, and if lower than five meters, the bird has to repeat the process again and again.
