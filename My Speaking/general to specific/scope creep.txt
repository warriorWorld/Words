The reading is about scope creep, it states that scope creep is when you have an agreement with your customers, you must rigidly regulate the extents of the agreement. Otherwise, it may lead to conflicts between you and your customers.
The professor elaborates on this by providing an example.
He said his friend is a constructor, and once, his friend had an agreement with a woman. The agreement is about constructing a wooden fence for the woman. The professor's friend thought that the work was simple, so he didn't pay much attention to the agreement's details. And when the work was done, the woman asked the professor's friend to paint the fence white. The professor's friend was shocked, because he didn't consider the painting was included in the agreement. And he wanted to charge the woman an extra fee for this, and the woman was unhappy with the extra charge.
