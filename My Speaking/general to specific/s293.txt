The reading is about scatter hoarding, it states that some animals would store their food in a lot of different places when the food is plentiful, and consume it when the food is scarce.
The professor mentioned  a kind of squirrel who lives in the North Estern United States, and they also eat nuts just like the other squirrels. They would store nuts in autumn and eat them in winter. Before they store the nuts they will clean them, maybe because in this way the nuts could store for a longer period, or maybe they just want the nuts easier to eat. The squirrels would dig holes, each hole can store one hundred nuts, but instead of just storeing their one hundred nuts in one hole, they dig one hundred holes and then store one nut per hole. In this way, even    other animals find one or few holes, the squirrel can still have a lot of food in winter.
