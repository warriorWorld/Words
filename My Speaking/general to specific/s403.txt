The reading is about agnistic behavior, it states that when two animals want the same resource, they will show power to eachother, and the weak one will just leave, while the strong one gets the resource.
The professor elaborates on this by providing an example.
He mentioned scientists found two rattlesnakes in a hole, they both wanted the same food in the hole. They faced each other, and stayed as tall as possible. Each of them wanted to gain control of the other, but neither of them tried to bite or injure the other. Finally, one of them gained control, but this one didn't hurt the other, even though it has the ability to do so. The weak one just left and went to another hole.
