The reading is about the diffusion effect in health study. It states that when two groups in an experiment share information with each other the result of the study will become useless. 
The professor elaborates on this by giving an example.
She mentioned that someone wants to know whether or not exercise will affect stiffness in our bodies. And he divides people into two groups, A group will take some exercise, and B group will do things as normal. And someday, someone in A group talked about the exercise making him feel really better, and someone in the B group heard about that, and started to exercise too. This makes the experiment result useless.
