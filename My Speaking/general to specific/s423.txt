The reading is about habituation, it states that habituation is when animals facing threat, they would react intensively, such as running away and barking to alert companions. However, when they realize that the event or thing is harmless, they will cease to respond to it.
The professor elaborates on this by providing an example.
He said there is a kind of small animal called a prairie dog who lives on grassland. Prairie dogs live in groups. When they first encounter humans, they would bark sharply and it sounds just like a dog. And if humans come and go frequently without harming the prairie dogs everytime day after day. The prairie dogs would realize that humans are not dangerous to them. And they will cease to react to humans.
