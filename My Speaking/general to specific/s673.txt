The reading is about the nomadic phase. It states that when some animals need additional food, they will start living as nomadic species, and when they don't need additional food anymore, they will stop moving and live in one location again.
The professor mentioned ants as an example of this. There is a kind of ant who lives underground. When they have a lot of baby ants, and since baby ants need a lot of nutrition, they will start moving to another location in order to find additional food.  This trip will continue until those baby ants grow up.  And when they don't need additional food anymore, they will find a new place to live.
