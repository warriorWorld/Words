The reading is about social loafing. It states that when people work together in a group, their motivation will remain low compared to work individually.
The professor mentioned peeling potatoes as an example. The researcher lets some people peel potatoes individually, and tells them their peeled number will be recorded. And let other people peel potatoes together in a group, and tell them only their total peeled count will be recorded. And the result showed that the people who work in a group have significantly fewer average numbers compared to the ones who peel potatoes individually.
