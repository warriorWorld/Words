The reading is about familiarity principle. It states that people tend to select things that they are already familiar with, even if they are not consciously aware of it.
The professor elaborates on this by giving an example.
He mentioned some researchers put students in a dim room and then showed them several geometric shapes each for one second. Then, they show them several pairs of geometric shapes, and let the students select one from each pair. The result showed that students are more likely to select the shapes that they were seen in the first step. And those scientists ask the students whether or not they have seen the shape before, those students are not sure.
