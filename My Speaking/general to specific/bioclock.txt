The lecturer explains the bio clock by giving an example.
First, she describes there are two types of bio clock, one is the inner bio clock, and two is the external bio clock. And scientists found that in reality, the bio clock is in between, which means that animals may have both an inner bio clock and an external bio clock. They use flying squirrels for an experiment. Those squirrels sleep during the day and are active during the night. They put the squirrels in constant darkness for one month. And find out that the squirrels still do their activities regularly, but not exactly 24 hours but 23.5 hours. this may prove that the inner bio clock exists but it is not exact. And then they bring back the squirrels to daylight, at first, those squirrels still live their lives according to their inner bio clock, which means they may wake up during the day. But gradually, they went back to their normal life.
In conclusion, the inner bio clock exists but is not exact, it needs the external bio clock to correct it.
