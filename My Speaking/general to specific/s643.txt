The reading is about the paradox of choice. It states that when people have too many choices, they would feel anxious and hard to make a choice.
The professor mentioned himself as an example of this.
He mentioned he went to a store and wanted some jeans. He was surprised because there were so many types of jeans, all those colours, with buttons, and without buttons. You know, in the past, there were only two kinds of jeans, light blue and blue ones. It took 2 hours for the professor buying the jeans rather than 5 minutes. And after the purchase, the professor had a headache and was anxious.
