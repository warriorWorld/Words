The reading is about exaptation. It states that some animals can use their old features for new purposes and still use those old features for old purposes.
The professor mentioned a kind of bird as an example of this. This kind of bird lives in marshes and rivers, they prefer shallow waters. This kind of bird loves to eat fish, and because of sunlight, they cannot see fish underwater clearly. In order to see fish that hide under water, they use their wings to block sunlight just like an umbrella. In this way, they can catch their prey easily.
