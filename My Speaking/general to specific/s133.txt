The reading is about perceptual constancy. It states that even though objects seem different from different angles to look, we humans still consider the object is the same.
The professor elaborates on this by giving two examples.
First, he mentioned when you see a round plate from different angles you will see it differently, sometimes it is round, and sometimes if you see it horizontally it is oval in shape. But you still recognize it as a plate.
Second, the professor mentioned himself as an example of this. He said when students sit in the first row of the class they will see a large professor, and when they sit in the back row of the class they will see a smaller professor. But they wouldn't think the professors are two different people.
