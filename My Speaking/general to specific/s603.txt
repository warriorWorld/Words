The reading is about deceptive catching. It states that some animals would store their food in order to eat it sometime later. And some animals would steal the food, and the animals who stored the food would use the deceptive catching strategy in order to deal with this.
The professor mentioned squirrels as an example of this. Squirrels would store nuts in holes that they dug, and sometimes jays would steal them from squirrels. As a result, squirrels would dig a whole bunch of holes and put twigs and stones in them, then cover them with dirt as if nuts were in there. When jays can only find stones and twigs in them, they would lose interest in them and give up on the holes.
