The reading is about ritualization. It states that some animal behaviors originally have their own practical uses, but overtime the behaviors become signals.
The professor mentioned dogs as an example of this. When dogs feel threatened they will show their teeth to other animals, and those animals will understand the meaning of this. This is because a long long time ago, before dogs bite other animals, they would always show their teeth first, and then bite them. And overtime, this behavior was repeated again and again. Gradually, other animals and dogs themselves all realized that the dogs don't need to actually bite in order to threaten other animals, they could only show their teeth, and other animals would understand.
