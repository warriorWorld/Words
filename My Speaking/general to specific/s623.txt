The reading is about the illusion of transparency. It states that when we have strong emotions, we tend to think others can see through us.
The professor elaborates on this by giving an example.
He mentioned that he was invited to a dinner party by his friend, and since his friend Marry is good at cooking, he expected the food to be good. But, it turns out the food contained garlic as ingredients. The professor doesn't like garlic. So he pretended to be normal. Afterward, he asked his friend Mike who was also invited, was he behaved normally during the party. And Mike said he didn't notice that the professor doesn't like garlic. And it turns out, Marry also didn't notice that the professor didn't like the meal.
