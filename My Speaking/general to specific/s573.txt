The reading is about root communication. It states that some plants can communicate through their roots, in this way, they can secure water and avoid competing with each other.
The professor mentioned creosote plants as an example of this. Creosotes live in deserts, they usually space far away from other plants. When other plant roots are too close to theirs, they will secrete a kind of chemical from their roots that can change other plant roots' growing direction. In this way, they can protect their territory and secure water for themselves. This feature helped creosote plants survive in deserts.
