The professor elaborates on this by giving an example.
He mentioned that when you were 13 years old, you invited a lot of friends to your home. And your mom showed up and let you do some chores such as wash dishes. You felt so embarrassed in front of your friends. Your friends considered that you are such a baby. You had a sigh, and made a face in order to try to tell your friends and your mom that you are not a kid anymore.
