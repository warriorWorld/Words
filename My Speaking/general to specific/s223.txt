The reading is about irrational commitment. It states that when people do some project, they will have more and more commitment toward the project along with the progress forward, even irrationally.
The professor mentioned a few years ago, he and his wife bought a house, at first, his wife thought the house condition was poor, but the professor considered the architecture of that house being good, so, eventually, they bought it. But soon, they found that the house condition was even worse than they first imagined, they had to repair the roof and the electrical system. In the end they had to turn down the wall in order to solve the electrical issue. But the professor became more and more committed toward the house repairment along the way, because if he didn't, his wife will consider she was right in the first place. At least the professor thought so at that time.
