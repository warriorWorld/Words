The reading is about signaling, it states that customers usually want to pay high prices for high quality products. And businessmen must find a way to inform their customers of the qualities of the products.
The professor elaborates on this by giving an example.
The professor mentioned he has a friend who owned a jewelry store. And the jewelry often costs thousands of dollars. Therefore, customers must have faith in the authenticity of the jewelry, otherwise, they won't buy it. For this reason, the store owner has an expert examined all her jewelry and certified them. Customers can have faith in the certifications because the expert is a leading expert in jewelry, and because the expert doesn't work for the store owner.
