The reading is about ecosystem resistance. It states that when the ecosystem has a high diversity of species it can resist some sudden changes.
The professor mentioned Pacific coral reefs as an example of this. A few years ago, the ocean was polluted by a ship's oil, and a lot of fish died out. As a result, the algae population increased dramatically because the fish who would eat them have gone. But the coral reefs weren't affected by this, even the algae is detrimental to them. This is because a lot of other fish species began to eat algae, and the algae population was controlled quickly.
