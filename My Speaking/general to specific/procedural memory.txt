The reading is about procedural memory. It states that procedural memory is the memory that when you perform a task repeatedly for a long time, and even after years, you can automatically perform the task.
The professor elaborates on this by providing an example.
He said when he was a boy, he learned how to play guitar from how to hold it to how to place your fingers on it. He practiced it for hours per day. And after several years of practice, he went to a university. And he stop playing guitar for years, but once he went back to his home, he found the guitar, and pick it up, then played it, and he found out that he can play it very smoothly without any trouble. He even can't explain how he performed the task.
