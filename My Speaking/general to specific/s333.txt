The reading is about carrying capacity. It states that carrying capacity is an organism population capacity of a giving area  that can sustained, and when an environment is stable, the environment's carrying capacity will also be stable, by contrast, if the environment was disturbed, the environment's carrying capacity will also be affected.
The professor elaborates on this by giving an example.
He mentioned there is a kind of moth which is black and red. The moths feed on reeds, and when the reed population decreases, the moth population will also decrease. But due to they already lay a lot of eggs in the forest before, next year, when the rainfall returned, the reed population will recover, and the moth population will also recover, and they will lay more eggs compared to the previous year.
