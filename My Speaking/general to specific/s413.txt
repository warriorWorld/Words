The reading is about Primacy Effect, it states that when people give someone an initial judgment, they tend to notice the positive evidence that enhances the impression, and ignore the negative evidence that weakens the impression.
The professor elaborates on this by providing two examples.
First, he mentioned his own experience. When he just entered his company, he gave a suggestion to an experiment, and the experiment was a success. After that, the boss always thinks that the professor is great, and considers him the star researcher, even the professor is only an average one.
On the other hand, the professor's colleague wasn't that lucky. When she first entered the company, she made a mistake that led to the company losing a lot of money and time. As a result, the boss always believes that she is unreliable, even though she is actually better than the professor.
