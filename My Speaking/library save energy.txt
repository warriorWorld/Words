The university library announced a plan to reduce energy consumption. First, it will replace its lights. Second, the air conditioning will keep warmer on hot days.
There are two reasons why the women opposes this announcement.
First of all, she argues that the lights are much dimmer than before, thus, a lot of students have to bring their own light to the library. As a result, this part of the energy-saving plan will fail.
Moreover, she mentions that students went into that library because the library is comfortable. And if the air-conditioning keeps warmer during the hot days, students will just study in their dorm room. And the dorm rooms are much noisier than the library.
