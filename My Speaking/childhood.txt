I don't think a person's best time in his life is his childhood.
First, children must rely on others to live, and many parents are not qualified as parents. For example, in my country, there are a considerable amount of parents who see their children as their own property. They treat their child not as a human but as a machine. There is a high school called Hengshui high school in my country, which is well-known in my country for its military-management policy. I think whoever went into that very school will certainly not agree with the idea that a person's best time is his childhood.
Second, children are generally not financially independent, they usually don't have enough money to buy what they want without their parent's help. For instance, when I was a child, I really liked playing games.  but I don't have sufficient money to buy them at that time. Today, after I finally got economically independent from my parents, I bought a lot of games and game devices, such as Monster Hunter, Play Station 5, Switch, and a gaming PC.
