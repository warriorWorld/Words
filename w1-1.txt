The package mainly talks about three benefits of a four-day week. the lecturer refutes the idea by saying that although a four-day week appears beneficial, It has some problems and those problems made that four-day week will not work in practice.

First, the reading package deems that hiring more staff would not result in additional payroll costs because four-day employees would only be paid 80 percent. On the contrary, the lecturer casts doubt on this point and contents that hiring more staff means more training, health, office rent, and computer costs.

Second, another crucial point in the reading part is that a four-day week would reduce unemployment rates because employers will hire more staff. the lecturer challenges this idea by saying that employers will expect foud-day workers to work more until it reaches a five-day worker workload, thus no additional employee will be employed.

Lastly, the writer of the reading package claims that a four-day worker will benefit from it. Whereas the lecturer insists an opposite opinion that those four-day workers will be lost their job because their job ability dropped.
